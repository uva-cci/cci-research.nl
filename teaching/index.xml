Whilst applying modelling techniques, a broader architectural view is taken, in which students are made aware of choices in e.g. framing and scoping. This course prepares students to exchange knowledge with domain stakeholders, and to communicate potential design decisions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Offensive Technologies</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/offensive_technologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/offensive_technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the offensive technologies course, students learn how to test and judge the security of many IT related components,
such as hardware and network protocols. They also learn how to report such findings and patch them, while also
studying how to create offensive technologies themselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Operating Systems</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/operating_systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/operating_systems/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the Operating Systems course, students learn how applications
interact with the hardware via the operating system, and how the
operating system solves various tasks for the applications such as CPU
scheduling, and memory and storage management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding these basics is very important to analyse and tune the
performance of a system to a particular application. In the Complex
Cyber Infrastructure group, we are often dealing with very high
performance hardware, such as 400 Gbps fiber links, and large storage
volumes. To have e.g. data-processing applications make full use of this
hardware, requires tuning the operating system to the specific workload,
and this is where the fundamental operating system knowledge comes in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compiler construction</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cryptographic Engineering</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/cryptographic_engineering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/cryptographic_engineering/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DevOps</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/devops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/devops/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Organisatie: analyse en ontwikkeling</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/organisatie_analyse_en_ontwikkeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/organisatie_analyse_en_ontwikkeling/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the course Organisational Analysis and Developement (in Dutch Organisatieontwikkeling and -ontwikkeling) we study how collaborations between organisations influence IT-architectures that support cross-organisational collaboration. Particularly, we focus on data-sharing aspects and usage control that is required to create trust essential to collaboration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparation Masterproject Software Engineering</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/prep_master_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/prep_master_project/</guid><description>&lt;p>During paper sessions, students learn skills to find, read and assess relevant scientific publications.

With the advent of big data and large-scale computation, cryptography can offer us much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course focuses on Secure Computation that has developed as a central tool in cryptography â€” This allows multiple distributed parties to jointly compute on their private inputs, with the guarantee that nothing beyond the output is revealed. The current and potential impact of secure computing is widespread across scenarios where data sharing is constrained due to legal, ethical, or privacy reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>gives a comprehensive treatment of foundations of secure computation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>explains protocols for special secure computing tasks such as zero-knowledge proofs, private set intersection and private information retrieval.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>demonstrates use cases of real-world systems where secure computing protocols have been / could be deployed, including ZCash (a privacy-focused cryptocurrency) and the Apple CSAM Detection System.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The primary aim of the course is to enable students to acquire the basic concepts and skills needed to follow the current research trends in theory and practice of secure computation. This course is closely linked to data protection and privacy in large-scale computation, which aligns with the research interests of CCI researchers working on security and privacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Evolution</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/software_evolution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/software_evolution/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Software Specification Verification and Testing</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/software_spec_and_testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/software_spec_and_testing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Web and Media Tech</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/web_and_media_tech/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/web_and_media_tech/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Computer Systems</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/computer_systems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/computer_systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Introduction to Security</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/introduction_to_security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/introduction_to_security/</guid><description>&lt;p>Security is one of the most important extra-functional property of systems. Essential yet often overlooked, security ensures that our daily transactions remain protected, that our infrastructure operates regularly and that our communication stays private and safe from unauthorized parties. The aim of Introduction to Security is to provide solid foundations on the overall security domain, starting from the core components of cryptographic theory, implementations and cryptanalysis. Subsequently, it shows how secure are used to build the cryptographic protocols deployed in our everyday life, and we continue by covering the fundamentals of operating systems&amp;rsquo; security, intrusion detection/prevention and recent research topics such as privacy-preserving technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within CCI, our research strives to develop and apply open-source, efficient, protected and tailor-made cryptographic implementations that ensure the security, privacy and availability of our society&amp;rsquo;s communication infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Netwerkorganisatie</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/netwerkorganisatie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/netwerkorganisatie/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course Network Organisation is focused on the questions why and how organisations collaborate in a complex environment. Studying those collaborations students are aimed to get better insights in how organisations function in a dynamic context. The students use system dynamic modelling to represent those collaborations and develop quantitative dynamic models that support policy decisions that affect the stakeholders in such complex enviroment&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Protection Technologies</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course focuses on technologies that can be used to protect data from unauthorized access. The main motivation is to protect personal data and comply with data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The course&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>explains the context of data protection technologies from multiple angles (e.g., legal requirements, interplay with other quality attributes);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conveys in-depth knowledge on some specific data protection technologies (e.g., cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, anonymization and pseudonymization, differential privacy, access control, anonymous communications);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>showcases applications of data protection technologies (in particular, privacy-preserving machine learning and location privacy).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The course is closely linked to the research performed by CCI researchers in the field of security and privacy (for example, in the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/secured/">SECURED&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect">FogProtect&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/epi">EPI&lt;/a> projects).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
