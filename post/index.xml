&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) Inference in Edge Computing, often coined Edge Intelligence, requires solutions to insure that
sensitive data confidentiality and intellectual property are not revealed in the process. Privacy-preserving Edge Intelligence
is only emerging, despite the growing prevalence of Edge Computing as a context of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service. Solutions have
yet to be applied to state-of-the-art DNNs. This position paper provides an original assessment of the compatibility of existing
techniques for privacy-preserving DNN Inference with the characteristics of an Edge Computing setup. The resulting favorite
candidate is secret sharing. We then address the future role of model compression methods in the research towards secret sharing
on DNNs with state-of-the-art performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assistant or Associate Professor in Security and Privacy</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2023-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2023-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Join our team!

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @JURIX2022</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>Can a military autonomous device follow International Humanitarian Law?&lt;/b> by Tomasz Zurek, Jonathan Kwik, Mostafa Mohajeriparizi and Tom Van Engers was accepted at &lt;a href="https://jurix2022.rechtsinformatik.saarland/">&lt;b>35th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems&lt;/b>&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>iCoLa: A Compositional Meta-language with Support for Incremental Language Development&lt;/strong>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase programming productivity and safety. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which specialized languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. Finally, we demonstrate iCoLa through a case-study in which we construct &lt;em>Imp&lt;/em>, &lt;em>SIMPLE&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>MiniJava&lt;/em> through the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open PhD position</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2022-09/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2022-09/</guid><description>&lt;p>Is it possible to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning, while increasing its security and privacy?

Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam &amp;mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities.
&lt;img src="8P9A9066.JPG" alt="Early birds">&lt;/p>
&lt;p align = "center">
Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat.
The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events.
One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the
Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was
hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat
went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center" style="display: inline-block;">
&lt;img src="8P9A9073.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9079.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist.
Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9101.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9128.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks.
&lt;img src="8P9A9299.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9223.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9333.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time
to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/ana-oprescu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana&lt;/a> and her entourage on to the boat.
But first, there were two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/daphnee-chabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daphne&lt;/a>, taking the opportunity to swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around &lt;i>normative advisors&lt;/i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Master Software Engineering student papers accepted at BENEVOL’22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bas van den Brink’s work on applying model-based testing to microservices has been accepted as a proceedings contribution to &lt;a href=

My point with this, is to bring attention to a compromise parents might not have to make anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Work traveling with Maria.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my home country, mothers can spend up to two years of almost fully paid maternal leave. The Netherlands, with their 16 weeks is a far cry. Luckily, my husband, a freelancing mathematician, can travel with me and take care of Maria while I am participating in the various work activities. As such, Maria has already joined the Nijmegen SusTrainable Teacher Training before she had turned 1, and then joined ICT4S and the SusTrainable summer school. It has not been easy, and the EU does not help in any way, but the UvA is a great employer in this sense, and I can focus much better while traveling for work, knowing I will join Maria in the late afternoon, as if a normal day at ‘home’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ana Oprescu will join as co-chair the Amsterdam Data Science Thesis Award PC</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/anna-join-ds-award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/anna-join-ds-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please send your Bachelor and/or Master thesis nominations &lt;a href="https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/news/2022-ads-thesis-awards/#:~:text=Amsterdam%20Data%20Science%20(ADS)%20is,the%208th%20of%20December%202022">here&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
​​European Union has aggregated the current societal concerns into two seemingly orthogonal directions: the Green Deal and the GDPR. In this paper, we begin to analyse trade-offs in preserving privacy, learning from the data, and saving energy. Considerable research studied the energy efficiency of software and the accuracy of machine learning models trained on anonymised datasets. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the impact of anonymisation techniques on energy consumption. We measure the impact of anonymisation on the energy consumption and on the accuracy of machine learning models.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
We find that the k-value has a statistically significant impact on the energy consumption of the chosen anonymization algorithms. In terms of the accuracy of machine learning models, the generalisation and suppression performs better in almost all cases, provided that proper anonymization hierarchies are used in the anonymization process. However, we find that for the larger and more complex dataset, the reduction in accuracy is limited while there is a significant difference in energy consumption. Thus when considering energy consumption we conclude that for larger datasets it might be worthwhile to consider using microaggregation over generalisation and suppression.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the same event, Lukas Koedijk also presented the &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9830107/">paper&lt;/a> co-authored with Ana Oprescu based on his master graduation project on the Energy Footprint of Programming Languages. Lukas is an alumnus of the Software Engineering master, now working at KPMG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Green Deal mirrors the societal concern regarding climate change. In the software industry this means reducing the energy consumption of a program. This can be done by looking both at the hardware and the software used. We take a software approach and focus on the programming language choices and how a computer program is written. The programming languages we investigate are Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C++ and C#. We compare programs from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game and these programs are divided in groups that solve the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that the choice of programming language and the way of writing your program influences the energy consumption. The programming languages that consume the least amount of energy over all the problems are C and C++, albeit these programming languages consume more energy when compilation flags are minimized. However, in some cases we could not prove that there was a difference in the energy consumption. We also find that the hardware used to run the programs has an influence on the energy consumption. We find that the runtime of a program correlates with the energy consumption, but a shorter runtime does not necessarily result in a lower energy consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the colocated &lt;a href="https://gsd.web.elte.hu/events/sustrainable">SusTrainable workshop&lt;/a>, Ana also presented current research efforts on Energy-driven Software Engineering. The workshop was organised by the Erasmus+ project &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.github.io/">SusTrainable&lt;/a>, in which UvA is a partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Climate Law targets climate neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the Knowledge Economy is deemed crucial to EU prosperity. Thus, the energy footprint of software services remains an important topic of research and education. In these lecture notes, we set out to educate students on energy-aware software engineering. We show how to establish whether some programming languages are inherently more “green”. We also show how to assess whether established software smells (anti-patterns) are also energy-related smells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering master student Nuria Bruch wins VERSEN Master Thesis Award!</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nuria Bruch, supervised by Ana Oprescu, Miroslav Zivkovic and Lodewijk Bergmans wins the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sig_eu/status/1525150139614171138">VERSEN Master Thesis Award&lt;/a> for her work on &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4280883#.YtqQxdJByV5">measuring the degree of library dependency!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usage of libraries, both commercial and open-source, encapsulating the implementation of certain functionalities is a widespread practice among developers. However, when a developer uses a library in a software product, this creates a dependency, and if a library has a security issue, it can be propagated to the software product. Developers can use package managers, however, these generally offer a simple binary evaluation of the dependencies: either there is one or not. Hence, a detailed evaluation of the dependencies is missing, which could help developers deal with vulnerabilities, breaking changes, and deprecated dependencies. Nuria proposes a model for software dependencies, which can help provide a fine-grained evaluation of them. The model includes three types of metrics: coupling, coverage, and usage per class. For each metric in the model, Nuria provides a formal definition and a theoretical validation by proving the metrics’ properties. She additionally implemented a proof-of-concept tool that, given a library from the Maven Central Repository, calculates the metrics of the model for each of the dependencies using bytecode analysis. Moreover, the proof-of-concept includes a visualisation of the dependency tree, including the calculated metrics. Finally, she conducted experiments to validate the model, the implementation of the proof-of-concept, and the visualisation. The experiments include interviews with 15 professional developers who evaluated the clarity and actionability of the model’s metrics and the proposed visualisations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SusTrainable summer school</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.uniri.hr/">Rijeka SusTrainable summer school&lt;/a> (4-8 July 2022, Rijeka, Croatia) organised by the Erasmus+ project SusTrainable Ana Oprescu gave a lecture on the methodologies employed for Energy-driven Software Engineering research.
