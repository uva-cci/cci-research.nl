The UVA team included Sander Klous, Anestis Dalgitsis, Alexandros Koufakis, Cees de Laat (left to right on picture) and Paola Grosso (not pictured).\nWe showcased the results of two distinct research efforts. The first project, led by Anestis, focused on LLM-Based Optimization Algorithm Selection for High-Performance Networks Orchestration. The second, led by Alexandros, demonstrated Policy-aware Distributed Vertical Federated Learning infrastructure. Both works used the FABRIC testbed and live demonstrations took place at the CIENA booth.

The proposed solution introduces a context-aware abstraction layer where LLMs analyze network logs, service requests, and algorithm metadata to dynamically select the most suitable optimization strategy. We validate our framework through a prototype deployed on the FABRIC FAB international testbed and through simulations across diverse scenarios (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, V2X, AR/VR), showing that LLM-driven selection achieves higher success rates and SLA compliance while balancing efficiency, accuracy, and inference latency. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this method and highlight its potential to enable scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving orchestration.\nPaper and demonstration\nPolicy-aware distributed Vertical Federated Learning infrastructure Harnessing the power of data is paramount to unlocking more effective applications, especially with the rise of machine learning. Data regulation, both through legislation and company policies, makes it impractical for different companies to learn from multiple datasets at once. Digital Data Marketplaces aim to solve this issue, by providing a platform where organizations can exchange data based on (dynamic) policies. The digital data marketplace enforces these policies, allowing only data exchange that does not violate policies.\nIn this work we demonstration how multiple geographically distributed companies can train a unified machine learning model collaboratively using Vertical Federated Learning. Towards this goal we designed and implemented Scattered Directive, a state-of-the-art distributed infrastructure deployment utilizing FABRIC, capable of automatically deploying a digital data marketplace platform. Scattered Directive is built ontop of DYNAMOS, a middleware for datachange systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the effect of dynamic data sharing policies and the impact on the universal model training.\nDemonstration \u0026amp; More material\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank CIENA for their support.

Our paper, “Microservices-based FABRIC Implementation of Collaborative Model Training Scenario with Vertical Federated Learning,” tackled the challenge of using geographically distributed proprietary data for collaborative AI model training while adhering to data privacy and protection. Using the DYNAMOS middleware and the FABRIC network, we demonstrated how the problem of building energy consumption prediction (inspired by our collaborators Prets) can be addressed using a diverse set of partners. Participants with heterogeneous datasets can collaborate to create a unified model for prediction building energy consumption, without compromising privacy or intellectual property. This solution could reinforce green energy adoption and enable more economically viable building renovation financing.\nTuesday on the SCinet Stage: On November 19, we took to the SCinet Theater on the exhibition floor to show our ideas in action.

These systems have in common that parties may play different roles in the realisation of applications, e.g., providing a service (such as creating data insights), infrastructure (such as compute or storage resources), or assets (such as datasets and algorithms). In such systems, organisations wish to retain control over the usage of their resources, e.g., to limit their availability, adhere to (privacy) regulations, or to protect commercial interests. To give control to resource owners, we propose systems in which policies are used to express usage constraints, mechanisms are available to enforce these constraints, and monitoring provides the information necessary for making enforcement decisions. Data exchange systems and digital data marketplaces are the primary application context, providing motivation and specific case studies.\nParticular challenges addressed by our work are:\nThe expression of laws, regulations, organisational policies and contractual agreements as enforceable system-level policies. This requires policy languages bridging the gap between legal statements and system-level events and distributed usage control mechanisms for policy enforcement. The distribution of control itself: different stakeholders (users, resource owners) contribute parts of the policy and control mechanisms (besides their contribution to the application itself). How can the policies expressed at location A affect decisions made at location B, considering the desire to avoid centralisation and considering that policies themselves may be sensitive? The automatic integration of formalised interpretations of legal sources places demands on the underlying enforcement mechanisms. Firstly, ex-post enforcement (observing and responding to violations after their occurrence) is required as not all information may be available or (interpretations of) legal sources may be conflicting. Secondly, policy decisions need to be accountable such that information on which these decisions are based (policies, meta-data, actual data) may need to be retained and may themselves by sensitive. Compliance-by-design. How and to what extent can we schedule the execution of applications or reconfigure the system\u0026rsquo;s configuration to ensure compliance with identified policy requirements. In this research theme we develop conceptual models, algorithms, protocols, languages and (prototype) tools that address these challenges.\nProjects Software Publications 2025 A Stable Model Semantics for eFLINT Norm Specifications and Model Checking Scenarios.

JustAct lays a foundation for the automatic enforcement of policies that are changed by the users on the fly.\nAbstract Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from individual consent to (inter)national laws. Verifying norm-compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some domains (e.g., healthcare), the norms themselves may be private. In contrast, standard solutions (e.g., access- and usage-control, smart contracts) reason about policies that are assumed to be public. Instead, we present a novel framework prescribing how decentralised agents decide which actions are justified, despite their partial views of the policy. Crucially, justifications are universal, e.g., accepted by future auditors. Agents establish a common notion of compliance through an (externally synchronized) agreement, which is the basis of each justification defined by policy fragments agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble.\n","date":1723593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723593600,"objectID":"d0ea661d85112e017388f47011916e43","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/discotec24/","publishdate":"2024-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/discotec24/","section":"post","summary":"On the 20th of June, Christopher Esterhuyse and Tim Mueller presented their paper (with L.

Thomas van Binsbergen is accepted by the Journal of Systems and Software.\nAbstract Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase a programmers’ productivity and the safety of a program. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which domain-specific languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling.\nIn this paper we present iCoLa+, an extensible meta-language implemented in Haskell supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. We demonstrate iCoLa+ through the construction of the Imp, SIMPLE, and MiniJava languages via the composition and restriction of language fragments, demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators, and demonstrate the different forms of extensions possible in iCoLa+.\n","date":1707350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707350400,"objectID":"afcea1bd31992fc3c6075bff390b63d1","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-jss24-02/","publishdate":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-accepted-at-jss24-02/","section":"post","summary":"The paper titled iCoLa+: An extensible meta-language with support for exploratory language development by Damian Frolich and L.

Experience has shown that these devices often have severe security problems and are common targets for malware. One approach to ensure that only trusted software is executed on these devices is Remote Attestation, which allows a verifier to attest the integrity of software running on such a prover device. As malware is typically not trusted, an infected device will fail to generate a valid signature, which allows the verifier to detect the presence of malware on the prover. To achieve its security guarantees, Remote Attestation requires a trust anchor, often found in the form of dedicated hardware on the prover. For IoT and embedded devices such hardware has only recently become largely deployed. Modern Remote Attestation protocols rely on classical asymmetric signatures that are vulnerable to quantum attacks, which are expected to become feasible in the near future. Considering the extensive usage of IoT and embedded systems combined with their long lifetime (in some applications), it is necessary to be able to retrofit these devices to support quantum secure Remote Attestation without incurring a prohibitive overhead. In this paper we present SPRAV, a software-based Remote Attestation system that leverages the Physical Memory Protection (PMP) primitive of RISC-V to achieve its security guarantees and employs quantum- safe cryptographic algorithms to ensure resistance against quan- tum attacks in the future. Our evaluation shows that it is feasible to deploy this solution on RISC-V devices without incurring a prohibitive overhead or the need for additional hardware, paving the way towards quantum-resistant functionalities also in IoT.\n","date":1699401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699401600,"objectID":"849a466343acbca37729b9df49148ec5","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/date-2024/","publishdate":"2023-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/date-2024/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper, Demonstrating Post-Quantum Remote Attestation for RISC-V Devices, authored by Maximilian Barger (MSc Computer Security student at VU Amsterdam), Marco Brohet and Francesco Regazzoni, has been accepted as an extended abstract at the 2024 Design, Automation \u0026amp; Test in Europe Conference \u0026amp; Exhibition (DATE).","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Paper Accepted at DATE 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":["Damian Frolich","L.

Thomas van Binsbergen (University of Amsterdam) is accepted at the 16th edition of the Software Language Engineering (SLE) conference.\nAbstract Software systems evolve more and more in complex and changing environments, often requiring runtime adaptation to best deliver their services. When self-adaptation is the main concern of the system, a manual implementation of the underlying feedback loop and trade-off analysis may be desirable. However, the required expertise and substantial development effort make such implementations prohibitively difficult when it is only a secondary concern for the given domain. In this paper, we present ASOS, a metalanguage abstracting the runtime adaptation concern of a given domain in the behavioral semantics of a domain-specific language (DSL), freeing the language user from implementing it from scratch for each system in the domain. We demonstrate our approach on RobLANG, a procedural DSL for robotics, where we abstract a recurrent energy-saving behavior depending on the context. We provide formal semantics for ASOS and pave the way for checking properties such as determinism, completeness, and termination of the resulting self-adaptable language. We provide first results on the performance of our approach compared to a manual implementation of this self- adaptable behavior. We demonstrate, for RobLANG, that our approach provides suitable abstractions for specifying sound adaptive operational semantics while being more efficient.\n","date":1696982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696982400,"objectID":"6c7e6df9c342185d382a399349c21d92","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/","publishdate":"2023-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/","section":"post","summary":"The paper titled Adaptive Structural Operational Semantics by Gwendal Jouneaux (Univ.

Lees, Tom van Engers, Cees de Laat has been published at Applied Mathematics and Computation. Abstract: External supervision services play an important role in combating corruption by detecting potential collusive bribery. This work aims at studying the dynamics of collusive bribery when participants have the option of engaging the external supervision services. To do so, we construct a basic model where collusive bribery can happen between the defecting participants who aim to escape from a punishment by offering a bribe to rule enforcers who monitor interactions among all participants. Among rule enforcers, only the corrupt ones accept the bribe and ignore the violations. The cooperative participants can engage the external supervision service at a certain cost to avoid the risk of potential collusive bribery. Under the framework of evolutionary game theory, we find that a higher initial fraction of honest enforcers is more likely to lead to a trusting cooperating equilibrium. We also find that, when allowing random exploration of available strategies, increasing the exploration rate of rule enforcers is effective in combating corruption for both infinite and finite populations. Lastly, we find that minimizing the cost of external supervision services is not always good. When the system evolves into a cooperating equilibrium, a low cost of external supervision service induces unnecessary costs of seeking external supervision. When the strategy profiles exhibit stable oscillations, there exists an optimal cost of external supervision, considering the trade-off between minimizing the chance of exposing cooperative participants to collusive bribery and strengthening the punishment on the corrupt enforcers. Premised on the results, we discuss practical management suggestions.\n","date":1688083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688083200,"objectID":"698675e8d19634661f7020ad368b6847","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-amc/","publishdate":"2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-published-amc/","section":"post","summary":"The paper titled The dynamics of corruption under an optional external supervision service by Xin Zhou, Adam Belloum, Michael H.

Congratulations, Danny!\nThe International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. IJCNN 2023 was hosted at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in Queensland, Australia.\nAbstract Encryption is a method to keep our data safe from third parties. However, side-channel information may be leaked during encryption due to physical properties. This information can be used in side-channel attacks to recover critical values such as the secret encryption key. To this end, it is necessary to understand the robustness of implementations to assess the security of data handled by a device. Side-channel attacks are one such method which allow researchers to evaluate the robustness of implementations using appropriate metrics.\nIn the security community, machine learning is playing a prominent role in the study of side-channel attacks. A notable example of this is the use of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) as a preprocessing step on the measurements. In this work we study in depth the problem of finding the most suitable architecture of such Convolutional Autoencoders. To this end, Optuna is used to explore the CAE hyperparameter space. This process allows us to identify hyperparameters that outperform state-of-the-art autoencoders, reducing the needed traces for a succesful attack by approximately 37% in the presence of Gaussian noise and reducing the trainable parameters needed to attack desynchronization by a factor of 29. In addition to the promising results, experiments carried out in this paper allow a better understanding of the hyperparameter space in the field of side channel attacks, providing a solid base for future use of CAE in this specific domain.\n","date":1687305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687305600,"objectID":"497ab069f8e82c3712b45d8fc3ca808f","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/ijcnn-2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ijcnn-2023/","section":"post","summary":"Danny van den Berg, BSc Natural and Social Sciences student majoring in Artifical Intelligence, presented the work he carried out for this thesis under the supervision of Tom Slooff (USI) and CCI at IJCNN 2023.

A threat plaguing these systems consists of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware, we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows, to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards, resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more harmonized evaluation.\n","date":168696e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":168696e4,"objectID":"ce024255cce149a9c984df39a7434af7","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-csur/","publishdate":"2023-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-published-csur/","section":"post","summary":"The paper 'A Survey on Thwarting Memory Corruption in RISC-V', authored by Marco Brohet and Francesco Regazzoni, has been published at ACM Computing Surveys.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Paper Published at ACM Computing Surveys","type":"post"},{"authors":["L.

This paper is a collaboration with the DiverSE team from Inria and the CWI SWAT group, and a significant contribution from a master\u0026rsquo;s thesis done at the CCI group.\nAbstract Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.\n","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"d6210a2a25cc69a131a87d78bdd2eb6a","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/second-paper-accepted-at-sle22/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/second-paper-accepted-at-sle22/","section":"post","summary":"The CCI group is well presented at the 15th edition of the Software Language Engineering (SLE) with another paper being accepted, titled: A Language-Parametric Approach to Exploratory Programming Environments by Thomas van Binsbergen, Damian Frolich, Mauricio Verano Merino, Joey Lai, Pierre Jeanjean, Tijs van der Storm, Benoit Combemale, and Olivier Barais.","tags":["Academic","Programming languages","Exploratory programming"],"title":"Another Paper Accepted @SLE22","type":"post"},{"authors":["Damian Frolich","L.

Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which specialized languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. Finally, we demonstrate iCoLa through a case-study in which we construct Imp, SIMPLE, and MiniJava through the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.\n","date":1663632e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663632e3,"objectID":"5cc1498a42e4c1cea3cd3832dbfb0a09","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/","publishdate":"2022-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/","section":"post","summary":"The paper titled iCoLa: A Compositional Meta-language with Support for Incremental Language Development by Damian Frolich and Thomas van Binsbergen is accepted at the 15th edition of the Software Language Engineering (SLE) conference.","tags":["Academic","Programming languages"],"title":"Paper Accepted @SLE22","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zoltan Mann"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Is it possible to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning, while increasing its security and privacy?

Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam \u0026mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities. Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat. The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events. One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.\nWith some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.\nArrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist. Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.\nWith the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks. After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome Ana and her entourage on to the boat. But first, there were two brave souls, Thomas and Daphne, taking the opportunity to swim.\nAll in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made. Are you interested in joining our social event next year? Keep an eye on our news sections for open positions.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to Yuri and Arno for taking pictures.\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"0e072fc4bf5e011329dd83fca7ca4447","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/social-event-2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/social-event-2022/","section":"post","summary":"To end the academic year in style, the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group went on a sailing trip on the Markermeer.

As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around normative advisors that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality.

In this paper, we begin to analyse trade-offs in preserving privacy, learning from the data, and saving energy. Considerable research studied the energy efficiency of software and the accuracy of machine learning models trained on anonymised datasets. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the impact of anonymisation techniques on energy consumption. We measure the impact of anonymisation on the energy consumption and on the accuracy of machine learning models. We find that the k-value has a statistically significant impact on the energy consumption of the chosen anonymization algorithms. In terms of the accuracy of machine learning models, the generalisation and suppression performs better in almost all cases, provided that proper anonymization hierarchies are used in the anonymization process. However, we find that for the larger and more complex dataset, the reduction in accuracy is limited while there is a significant difference in energy consumption. Thus when considering energy consumption we conclude that for larger datasets it might be worthwhile to consider using microaggregation over generalisation and suppression. During the same event, Lukas Koedijk also presented the paper co-authored with Ana Oprescu based on his master graduation project on the Energy Footprint of Programming Languages. Lukas is an alumnus of the Software Engineering master, now working at KPMG.\nAbstract: The EU Green Deal mirrors the societal concern regarding climate change. In the software industry this means reducing the energy consumption of a program. This can be done by looking both at the hardware and the software used. We take a software approach and focus on the programming language choices and how a computer program is written. The programming languages we investigate are Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C++ and C#. We compare programs from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game and these programs are divided in groups that solve the same problem.\nWe find that the choice of programming language and the way of writing your program influences the energy consumption. The programming languages that consume the least amount of energy over all the problems are C and C++, albeit these programming languages consume more energy when compilation flags are minimized. However, in some cases we could not prove that there was a difference in the energy consumption. We also find that the hardware used to run the programs has an influence on the energy consumption. We find that the runtime of a program correlates with the energy consumption, but a shorter runtime does not necessarily result in a lower energy consumption.\nDuring the colocated SusTrainable workshop, Ana also presented current research efforts on Energy-driven Software Engineering. The workshop was organised by the Erasmus+ project SusTrainable, in which UvA is a partner.\nAbstract: The EU Climate Law targets climate neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the Knowledge Economy is deemed crucial to EU prosperity. Thus, the energy footprint of software services remains an important topic of research and education. In these lecture notes, we set out to educate students on energy-aware software engineering. We show how to establish whether some programming languages are inherently more “green”. We also show how to assess whether established software smells (anti-patterns) are also energy-related smells.\n","date":1658448e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658448e3,"objectID":"fea101c2f8b1d0a5081edbe5f9f68b89","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-2/","publishdate":"2022-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ana-presented-2/","section":"post","summary":"Ana Oprescu presented her paper on the Energy Cost and Accuracy of K-anonymity in ICT4S (Mon 13 - Fri 17 June 2022 Plovdiv, Bulgaria).\nAbstract: ​​European Union has aggregated the current societal concerns into two seemingly orthogonal directions: the Green Deal and the GDPR.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Paper Presentation by Ana Oprescu @ICT4S","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ana Oprescu"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Nuria Bruch, supervised by Ana Oprescu, Miroslav Zivkovic and Lodewijk Bergmans wins the VERSEN Master Thesis Award for her work on measuring the degree of library dependency!\nThe usage of libraries, both commercial and open-source, encapsulating the implementation of certain functionalities is a widespread practice among developers. However, when a developer uses a library in a software product, this creates a dependency, and if a library has a security issue, it can be propagated to the software product. Developers can use package managers, however, these generally offer a simple binary evaluation of the dependencies: either there is one or not. Hence, a detailed evaluation of the dependencies is missing, which could help developers deal with vulnerabilities, breaking changes, and deprecated dependencies. Nuria proposes a model for software dependencies, which can help provide a fine-grained evaluation of them. The model includes three types of metrics: coupling, coverage, and usage per class. For each metric in the model, Nuria provides a formal definition and a theoretical validation by proving the metrics’ properties. She additionally implemented a proof-of-concept tool that, given a library from the Maven Central Repository, calculates the metrics of the model for each of the dependencies using bytecode analysis. Moreover, the proof-of-concept includes a visualisation of the dependency tree, including the calculated metrics. Finally, she conducted experiments to validate the model, the implementation of the proof-of-concept, and the visualisation.

The implementation of incentives is always costly and thus might fail to be enforced sustainably. This work aims at exploring the effects of incentives from an institutional perspective, while coping with the scenario where the third-party is part of the system but not composed by players. The evolutionary game theory (EGT) framework is applied to identify the incentives that lead to pure cooperation. In contrast to traditional EGT, this paper introduces an elimination mechanism that can reduce the market size. The incentives identified in the EGT analysis are further examined in simulation experiments which measure the market size, affluence and sustainability. The findings show\u0026#58; (1) light punishment leads to a reduction of the market size, yet heavier punishment is beneficial to the market size and wealth; (2) mixed incentives will generally lead to different wealth of the third party and of the participants. While under moderate strength, the wealth of both parties is the same and their overall wealth is maximal; (3) for sustainability, pure punishment (resp. reward) is sustainable (resp. unsustainable), the sustainability of mixed incentives depends on both their strength and agents’ rationality level.","tags":["Computer modelling and simulation","Applied mathematics","Institutional incentive","Sustainability","Evolutionary game theory"],"title":"Costly incentives design from an institutional perspective: cooperation, sustainability and affluence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Demchenko"],"categories":["News"],"content":"Scientific Large Scale Infrastructure for Computing/Communication Experimental Studies -preparation project (SLICES-PP) is a project with 25 partners and a budget of 3 M€ for 4 years.

These constructs refer to the ability of agents to adopt goals that are not fully grounded at the moment of invocation, refining them only when and where needed, the ability to select what-to (concretely) achieve at run-time. We present a preference-based approach to goal refinement, defining preferences based on extended Ceteris Paribus Networks (CP-Nets) for an AgentSpeak(L)-like agent programming language, and mapping the established CP-Nets logic and algorithms to guide the goal refinement step. As a technical contribution, we present an implementation of this method that solely uses a Prolog-like inference engine of the agent's belief-base to reason about preferences, thus minimally affecting the decision-making mechanisms hard-coded in the agent framework.","tags":["Data","AOP","BDI","Preferences"],"title":"Preference-Based Goal Refinement in BDI Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi","L.

If the resource requirements of the applications exceed the capacity of the edge data center, some non-latency-critical application components may be offloaded to the cloud. Such offloading may incur financial costs both for the use of cloud resources and for data transfer between the edge data center and the cloud. Moreover, such offloading may violate data protection requirements if components process sensitive data. The operator of the edge data center has to decide which components to keep in the edge data center and which ones to offload to the cloud. In this paper, we formalize this problem and prove that it is strongly NP-hard. We introduce an optimization algorithm that is fast enough to be run online for dynamic and automatic offloading decisions, guarantees that the solution satisfies hard constraints regarding latency, data protection, and capacity, and achieves near-optimal costs. We also show how the algorithm can be extended to handle multiple edge data centers. Experiments show that the cost of the solution found by our algorithm is on average only 2.7% higher than the optimum.","tags":["Data centers","Cloud computing","Costs","Data protection","Connectors","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Edge computing","Fog computing","Edge data center","Offloading","Resource optimization","Data protection"],"title":"Cost-optimized, data-protection-aware offloading between an edge data center and the cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zoltan Mann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653988636,"objectID":"0163a4f30a2b56315e8e6b29b64849ba","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/mann-decentralized-2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T09:17:16.441299Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mann-decentralized-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, cloud computing concepts have been extended towards the network edge, leading to paradigms like edge computing and fog computing. As a result, applications can be placed on a variety of resources, including fog nodes and cloud data centers. Application placement has significant impact on important metrics like latency. Finding an optimal application placement is computationally challenging, particularly because of the potentially huge number of infrastructure nodes and application components. To overcome the limited scalability of application placement algorithms, optimization can be decentralized, i.e., performed separately for different parts of the infrastructure. The infrastructure can be split into fog colonies, where a fog colony consists of the computational resources in a given geographical region. Application placement can then be performed for the individual fog colonies, thus mitigating the scalability problem. However, independent optimization of application placement in different fog colonies may lead to missed synergies and thus to sub-optimal overall results. Hence, some kind of coordination between fog colonies may be beneficial. In this paper, we analyze the effects of decentralization and coordination on the optimization results. In particular, we compare empirically four different approaches: (i) centralized decision-making, where decisions are made in one go for the entire infrastructure, (ii) independent fog colonies, where optimization is carried out in each fog colony independently from each other, (iii) fog colonies with communication, where excess application components in one fog colony can be sent to a neighboring fog colony, and (iv) fog colonies with overlaps, where shared resources may be dynamically distributed between neighboring fog colonies. Our experiments show that, for large problem instances, decentralization combined with coordination leads to the best results.","tags":["Peer-to-peer computing","Cloud computing","Optimization","Scalability","Edge computing","Task analysis","Bandwidth","Fog computing","Edge computing","Application placement","Distributed algorithms","Fog colonies"],"title":"Decentralized application placement in fog computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

We formalize a specific literature-based analysis framework using the identified key factors and drivers, which enables the evaluation of specific models in this domain. Through a systematic literature search, we identify 64 computational models to apply our framework. We highlight the development and contributions of various methodologies through an in-depth analysis of 13 high-quality models.

Thus, the modules of an application can be placed on a variety of nodes with different capabilities in terms of security, trustworthiness, and capacity. Application modules may exist in multiple instances. This makes it possible to assign users to the most appropriate module instances, taking into account requirements on security, privacy, and latency. There is a non-trivial interplay between application placement decisions and user assignment decisions. For example, if a certain user is assigned to a module, then that module may not be allowed to be placed on nodes not trusted by the user. However, most existing research neglects this interplay and its implications on security and privacy. In this paper, we address the joint problem of application placement and user assignment. Beside capacity and latency constraints, we consider several types of security and privacy constraints: (i) module-level location constraints, (ii) user-level location constraints, (iii) co-location constraints, and (iv) k-anonymity constraints. We formalize the problem and develop an algorithm to solve it using quadratically constrained mixed integer programming. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach by applying it to an IoT system in the smart home domain. Controlled experiments on problem instances of increasing size show that the algorithm can solve even large problem instances in acceptable time.","tags":[],"title":"Security- and Privacy-Aware IoT Application Placement and User Assignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jamila Alsayed Kassem","Adam Belloum","Tim Müller","Paola Grosso"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"97c6f26d6a29b94c45c1aec99ac7f963","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/alsayed-kassem-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alsayed-kassem-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Utilisation Profiles of Bridging Function Chain for Healthcare Use Cases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Kwik","Tom van Engers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985659,"objectID":"85abb8aca1e7ffa607ca685abf5024be","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/kwik-algorithmic-2021/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:39.143995Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kwik-algorithmic-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Under international law, weapon capabilities and their use are regulated by legal requirements set by International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Currently, there are strong military incentives to equip capabilities with increasingly advanced artificial intelligence (AI), which include opaque (less transparent) models. As opaque models sacrifice transparency for performance, it is necessary to examine whether their use remains in conformity with IHL obligations. First, we demonstrate that the incentives for automation drive AI toward complex task areas and dynamic and unstructured environments, which in turn necessitates resort to more opaque solutions. We subsequently discuss the ramifications of opaque models for foreseeability and explainability. Then, we analyse their impact on IHL requirements from a development, pre-deployment and post-deployment perspective. We find that while IHL does not regulate opaque AI directly, the lack of foreseeability and explainability frustrates the fulfilment of key IHL requirements to the extent that the use of fully opaque AI could violate international law. States are urged to implement interpretability during development and seriously consider the challenging complication of determining the appropriate balance between transparency and performance in their capabilities.","tags":[],"title":"Algorithmic fog of war: When lack of transparency violates the law of armed conflict","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Pascucci","Giovanni Sileno"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985657,"objectID":"825d22925ad36bc50888ef7eec54cda6","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/schweighofer-computability-2021-1/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:37.683821Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schweighofer-computability-2021-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Normative positions are sometimes illustrated in diagrams, in particular in didactic contexts.

Focusing on software, however, the use of masking can present various challenges: specifically, it often 1) requires significant effort to translate any theoretical security properties into practice, and, even then, 2) imposes a significant overhead in terms of efficiency. To address both challenges, this paper explores the use of an Instruction Set Extension (ISE) to support masking in software-based implementations of a range of (symmetric) cryptographic kernels including AES: we design, implement, and evaluate such an ISE, using RISC-V as the base ISA. Our ISE-supported first-order masked implementation of AES, for example, is an order of magnitude more efficient than a software-only alternative with respect to both execution latency and memory footprint; this renders it comparable to an unmasked implementation using the same metrics, but also first-order secure.","tags":[],"title":"An Instruction Set Extension to Support Software-Based Masking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rosario Cammarota","Francesco Regazzoni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985661,"objectID":"b5fe06d72ab1442085a7aca722e8022d","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/cammarota-guest-2021/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:41.638524Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cammarota-guest-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Guest Editors’ Introduction: Special Issue on Top Picks in Hardware and Embedded Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaume Abella","Sergi Alcaide","Jens Anders","Francisco Bas","Steffen Becker","Elke De Mulder","Nourhan Elhamawy","Frank K.

To break this dependency, this paper adopts a principled approach and implements a so-called exploring interpreter as a back-end to support various development environments for exploratory programming.","tags":[],"title":"A Generic Back-End for Exploratory Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Onno Valkering","Reginald Cushing","Adam Belloum"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"04148e48dff82c458c229bda8cecbc1b","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/valkering-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valkering-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Brane: A Framework for Programmable Orchestration of Multi-Site Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jamila Alsayed Kassem","Onno Valkering","Adam Belloum","Paola Grosso"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"4586d4387db709fb180bc9e26f6b8ee8","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/alsayed-kassem-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alsayed-kassem-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"EPI Framework: Approach for Traffic Redirection Through Containerised Network Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Sileno","Alexander Boer","Geoff Gordon","Bernhard Rieder"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"b1de39c9c0161274ab8d7eeb0253441a","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/rodriguez-doncel-like-2021/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:38.307356Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguez-doncel-like-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Like Circles in the Water: Responsibility as a System-Level Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Reginald Cushing","Ralph Koning","Cees de Laat","Paola Grosso"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"59970810807ddc5f7ff9d9f8547d0325","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/zhang-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Profiling and Discriminating of Containerized ML Applications in Digital Data Marketplaces (DDM)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geerten Rijsdijk","Giovanni Sileno"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"b30ec4adb1db27683826d791d43a77c0","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/baratchi-solving-2021/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:37.890871Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baratchi-solving-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Solving Hofstadter’s Analogies Using Structural Information Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Pascucci","Giovanni Sileno"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985657,"objectID":"90ac49f1d86ee7f72f05e81fa0c49032","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/basu-search-2021/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:37.483504Z","relpermalink":"/publication/basu-search-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Search for Symmetry in Hohfeldian Modalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu-Chi Liu","Giovanni Sileno","Tom van Engers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985658,"objectID":"7f9c795e1658241b2a968c114736bfac","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/villata-digital-2020/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:38.734417Z","relpermalink":"/publication/villata-digital-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The combination of smart contracts with blockchain technology enables the authentication of the contract and limits the risks of non-compliance.

However, even though many languages provide a REPL, the relation between the language as is and what is accepted at the REPL prompt is not always well-defined. Furthermore, implementing a REPL for new languages, such as DSLs, may incur significant language engineering cost. In this paper we survey the domain of REPLs and investigate the (formal) principles underlying REPLs. We identify and define the class of sequential languages, which admit a sound REPL implementation based on a definitional interpreter, and present design guidelines for extending existing language implementations to support REPL-style interfaces (including computational notebooks). The obtained REPLs can then be generically turned into an exploring interpreter, to allow exploration of the user's interaction. The approach is illustrated using three case studies, based on MiniJava, QL (a DSL for questionnaires), and eFLINT (a DSL for normative rules). We expect sequential languages, and the consequent design principles, to be stepping stones towards a better understanding of the essence of REPLs.","tags":["Interpreters","Note- books","Software language engineering","Language workbenches","Meta-languages","Repls"],"title":"A principled approach to REPL interpreters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi","Giovanni Sileno","Tom van Engers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":160272e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":160272e4,"objectID":"310ee43d59da0960ee43a487cd03b85f","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2020_mostafa/","publishdate":"2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prima2020_mostafa/","section":"publication","summary":"Current agent architectures implementing the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model consider agents which respond reactively to internal and external events by selecting the first-available plan. Priority between plans is hard-coded in the program, and so the reasons why a certain plan is preferred remains in the programmer's mind. Recent works that attempt to include explicit preferences in BDI agents treat preferences essentially as a rationale for planning tasks to be performed at run-time, thus disrupting the reactive nature of agents. In this paper we propose a method to include declarative preferences (i.e. concerning states of affairs) in the agent program, and to use them in a manner that preserves reactivity. To achieve this, the plan prioritization step is performed offline, by (a) generating all possible outcomes of situated plan executions, (b) selecting a relevant subset of situation/outcomes couplings as representative summary for each plan, (c) sorting the plans by evaluating summaries through the agent's preferences. The task of generating outcomes in several conditions is performed by translating the agent's procedural knowledge to an ASP program using discrete-event calculus.","tags":["Preferences","AOP","BDI"],"title":"Declarative Preferences in Reactive BDI Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi","Giovanni Sileno","Tom van Engers","Sander Klous"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":160272e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":160272e4,"objectID":"53259ce57f329dfb66ac092168918b33","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/agere2020_mostafa/","publishdate":"2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agere2020_mostafa/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper introduces an Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency.

For various reasons, certain plans might be preferred over others at design time. Most BDI agents platforms use hard-coding these preferences in some form of the static ordering of the reactive rules, but keeping the preferential structure implicit limits script reuse and generalization. This paper proposes an approach to add qualitative preferences over adoption/avoidance of procedural goals into an agent script, building upon the well-known notation of conditional ceteris paribus preference networks (CP-nets). For effective execution, the procedural knowledge and the preferential structure of the agent are mapped in an off-line fashion into a new reactive agent script. This solution contrasts with recent proposals integrating preferences as a rationale in the decision making cycle, and so overriding the reactive nature of BDI agents.","tags":["Preferences","AOP","BDI"],"title":"Integrating CP-Nets in Reactive BDI Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ameneh Deljoo","Ralph Koning","Tom van Engers","Leon Gommans","Cees de Laat"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569888e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985659,"objectID":"9d1f1fa39a13c7d22c41a7b921c6ec6a","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:39.767068Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Managing Effective Collaboration in Cybersecurity Alliances Using Social Computational Trust","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Demchenko"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985660,"objectID":"f8ae81c199235cdee0f96a26532d34b8","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-big-2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:40.389276Z","relpermalink":"/publication/demchenko-big-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Big Data Platforms and Tools for Data Analytics in the Data Science Engineering Curriculum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Demchenko","Reggie Cushing","Wouter Los","Paola Grosso","Cees de Laat","Leon Gommans"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985660,"objectID":"009880e590f71e893cc31ef476aa60c9","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:40.186684Z","relpermalink":"/publication/demchenko-open-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Open Data Market Architecture and Functional Components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuri Demchenko","Luca Comminiello","Gianluca Reali"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653985660,"objectID":"35620628a788000bb30b3fb50a4f006a","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T08:27:40.611427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Designing Customisable Data Science Curriculum Using Ontology for Data Science Competences and Body of Knowledge","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The DL4lD research project aims to help the Dutch logistics sector with digitalisation of their busines processes.

Sharing data across organizations in a secure, trusted and policy based manner, and enforcing the agreed use of that data is a hard problem. Many partial solutions already exist in the form of platforms, standards and directives, and back office solutions, all of them aimed at sharing data with their own goals and objectives. The absence of integrated solutions is hindering the potential exploitation of fused big data. Indeed, the research line “Data security in logistics” in the call underlines the importance of integrated cryptographically secure solutions.\nIn our proposal, typical logistics application profiles on specific demands in security, privacy, performance and policy will be identified. The goal of the proposed research is to develop end-to-end trusted and scalable solutions for typical application profiles that allow policy enforced data sharing and analysis across multiple IT domains based on negotiation of smart multi-party contracts. To achieve our goals, we will develop and integrate techniques for secure data sharing, scalability for big data, and policy-based data sharing and analytics. The ability to form temporary business alliances relies on the ability to implement ways to keep track of business agreements and transaction information in ways trusted by community members. The agility and diversity of market players, its data sources and potential risks if data is misused, is helped by creating a commonly trusted and governed infrastructure to access and share data. Such type of infrastructure is subject of research in Compartiment 1 of this call. In this proposal we will work alongside this work in order to investigate the value that blockchain technology will bring tosharing big data assets in a big data sharing infrastructure.

The aim is to not only protect primary data and limit accessibility via policy, but also to secure access to the provenance trails and other meta-data that are sensitive.\nThe main goals of this project are: Prove the value of distribute block chain approaches that can be applied to logistic use-cases (provided by industry partners and compartment 1 collaborators) Provide a future proof cryptographic approach considering the processing power quantum computing and other high performance compute technologies may bring. Provide an environment allowing parties to create data sharing agreements compliant to the digital market place policy thus guaranteeing secure and trustworthy real time sharing of big data. Provide secure mechanisms for compliancy checking using provenance trails and audit trails, and mechanisms for dispute settlement in case of breaches.
