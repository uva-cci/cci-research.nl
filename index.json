Priority between plans is hard-coded in the program, and so the reasons why a certain plan is preferred remains in the programmer's mind. Recent works that attempt to include explicit preferences in BDI agents treat preferences essentially as a rationale for planning tasks to be performed at run-time, thus disrupting the reactive nature of agents. In this paper we propose a method to include declarative preferences (i.e. concerning states of affairs) in the agent program, and to use them in a manner that preserves reactivity. To achieve this, the plan prioritization step is performed offline, by (a) generating all possible outcomes of situated plan executions, (b) selecting a relevant subset of situation/outcomes couplings as representative summary for each plan, (c) sorting the plans by evaluating summaries through the agent's preferences. The task of generating outcomes in several conditions is performed by translating the agent's procedural knowledge to an ASP program using discrete-event calculus.","tags":["Preferences","AOP","BDI"],"title":"Declarative Preferences in Reactive BDI Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mostafa Mohajeri Parizi","Giovanni Sileno","Tom van Engers","Sander Klous"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602720000,"objectID":"53259ce57f329dfb66ac092168918b33","permalink":"https://cci-research.nl/publication/agere2020_mostafa/","publishdate":"2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agere2020_mostafa/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper introduces an Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency. The novelty of this framework is in relying on the Actor model, instantiating each intentional agent as an autonomous micro-system run by actors. The working hypothesis behind this choice is that defining the agents via actors results in a more fine-grained modular architecture and that the execution of agent-oriented programs is enhanced (in scalability as well as in performance) by relying on robust implementations of Actor models such as Akka.

This approach requires such regulatory services to be closely aligned with a formal description of the relevant norms.\neFLINT is a domain-specific language developed for formalizing norms from a variety of sources. The theoretical foundations of the language are found in transition systems and in Hohfeld’s framework of legal fundamental conceptions. The language can be used to formalize norms from a large variety of sources. The resulting specifications are executable and support several forms of reasoning such as automatic case assessment, manual exploration and simulation. Moreover, the specifications can be used to develop regulatory services for several types of monitoring, control and enforcement.

For various reasons, certain plans might be preferred over others at design time. Most BDI agents platforms use hard-coding these preferences in some form of the static ordering of the reactive rules, but keeping the preferential structure implicit limits script reuse and generalization. This paper proposes an approach to add qualitative preferences over adoption/avoidance of procedural goals into an agent script, building upon the well-known notation of conditional ceteris paribus preference networks (CP-nets). For effective execution, the procedural knowledge and the preferential structure of the agent are mapped in an off-line fashion into a new reactive agent script. This solution contrasts with recent proposals integrating preferences as a rationale in the decision making cycle, and so overriding the reactive nature of BDI agents.","tags":["Preferences","AOP","BDI"],"title":"Integrating CP-Nets in Reactive BDI Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The DL4lD research project aims to help the Dutch logistics sector with digitalisation of their busines processes.

Sharing data across organizations in a secure, trusted and policy based manner, and enforcing the agreed use of that data is a hard problem. Many partial solutions already exist in the form of platforms, standards and directives, and back office solutions, all of them aimed at sharing data with their own goals and objectives. The absence of integrated solutions is hindering the potential exploitation of fused big data. Indeed, the research line “Data security in logistics” in the call underlines the importance of integrated cryptographically secure solutions.\nIn our proposal, typical logistics application profiles on specific demands in security, privacy, performance and policy will be identified. The goal of the proposed research is to develop end-to-end trusted and scalable solutions for typical application profiles that allow policy enforced data sharing and analysis across multiple IT domains based on negotiation of smart multi-party contracts. To achieve our goals, we will develop and integrate techniques for secure data sharing, scalability for big data, and policy-based data sharing and analytics. The ability to form temporary business alliances relies on the ability to implement ways to keep track of business agreements and transaction information in ways trusted by community members. The agility and diversity of market players, its data sources and potential risks if data is misused, is helped by creating a commonly trusted and governed infrastructure to access and share data. Such type of infrastructure is subject of research in Compartiment 1 of this call. In this proposal we will work alongside this work in order to investigate the value that blockchain technology will bring tosharing big data assets in a big data sharing infrastructure. The ability to provided trusted information from many distributed sources, such as mobile of tablet style devices that to not have to computational power to participate in traditional blockchain approaches, is an important topic address by this work. The aim is to not only protect primary data and limit accessibility via policy, but also to secure access to the provenance trails and other meta-data that are sensitive.\nThe main goals of this project are:  Prove the value of distribute block chain approaches that can be applied to logistic use-cases (provided by industry partners and compartment 1 collaborators) Provide a future proof cryptographic approach considering the processing power quantum computing and other high performance compute technologies may bring. Provide an environment allowing parties to create data sharing agreements compliant to the digital market place policy thus guaranteeing secure and trustworthy real time sharing of big data. Provide secure mechanisms for compliancy checking using provenance trails and audit trails, and mechanisms for dispute settlement in case of breaches.
