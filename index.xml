Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam &amp;mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities.
&lt;img src="8P9A9066.JPG" alt="Early birds">&lt;/p>
&lt;p align = "center">
Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat.
The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events.
One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the
Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was
hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat
went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center" style="display: inline-block;">
&lt;img src="8P9A9073.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9079.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist.
Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9101.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9128.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks.
&lt;img src="8P9A9299.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9223.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9333.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time
to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/ana-oprescu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana&lt;/a> and her entourage on to the boat.
But first, there were two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/daphnee-chabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daphne&lt;/a>, taking the opportunity to swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="8P9A9424.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made.

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around &lt;i>normative advisors&lt;/i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Master Software Engineering student papers accepted at BENEVOL’22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bas van den Brink’s work on applying model-based testing to microservices has been accepted as a proceedings contribution to &lt;a href=

&lt;h2>Work traveling with Maria.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my home country, mothers can spend up to two years of almost fully paid maternal leave. The Netherlands, with their 16 weeks is a far cry. Luckily, my husband, a freelancing mathematician, can travel with me and take care of Maria while I am participating in the various work activities. As such, Maria has already joined the Nijmegen SusTrainable Teacher Training before she had turned 1, and then joined ICT4S and the SusTrainable summer school. It has not been easy, and the EU does not help in any way, but the UvA is a great employer in this sense, and I can focus much better while traveling for work, knowing I will join Maria in the late afternoon, as if a normal day at ‘home’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ana Oprescu will join as co-chair the Amsterdam Data Science Thesis Award PC</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/anna-join-ds-award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/anna-join-ds-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please send your Bachelor and/or Master thesis nominations &lt;a href="https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/news/2022-ads-thesis-awards/#:~:text=Amsterdam%20Data%20Science%20(ADS)%20is,the%208th%20of%20December%202022">here&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
​​European Union has aggregated the current societal concerns into two seemingly orthogonal directions: the Green Deal and the GDPR. In this paper, we begin to analyse trade-offs in preserving privacy, learning from the data, and saving energy. Considerable research studied the energy efficiency of software and the accuracy of machine learning models trained on anonymised datasets. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the impact of anonymisation techniques on energy consumption. We measure the impact of anonymisation on the energy consumption and on the accuracy of machine learning models.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
We find that the k-value has a statistically significant impact on the energy consumption of the chosen anonymization algorithms. In terms of the accuracy of machine learning models, the generalisation and suppression performs better in almost all cases, provided that proper anonymization hierarchies are used in the anonymization process. However, we find that for the larger and more complex dataset, the reduction in accuracy is limited while there is a significant difference in energy consumption. Thus when considering energy consumption we conclude that for larger datasets it might be worthwhile to consider using microaggregation over generalisation and suppression.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the same event, Lukas Koedijk also presented the &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9830107/">paper&lt;/a> co-authored with Ana Oprescu based on his master graduation project on the Energy Footprint of Programming Languages. Lukas is an alumnus of the Software Engineering master, now working at KPMG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Green Deal mirrors the societal concern regarding climate change. In the software industry this means reducing the energy consumption of a program. This can be done by looking both at the hardware and the software used. We take a software approach and focus on the programming language choices and how a computer program is written. The programming languages we investigate are Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C++ and C#. We compare programs from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game and these programs are divided in groups that solve the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that the choice of programming language and the way of writing your program influences the energy consumption. The programming languages that consume the least amount of energy over all the problems are C and C++, albeit these programming languages consume more energy when compilation flags are minimized. However, in some cases we could not prove that there was a difference in the energy consumption. We also find that the hardware used to run the programs has an influence on the energy consumption. We find that the runtime of a program correlates with the energy consumption, but a shorter runtime does not necessarily result in a lower energy consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the colocated &lt;a href="https://gsd.web.elte.hu/events/sustrainable">SusTrainable workshop&lt;/a>, Ana also presented current research efforts on Energy-driven Software Engineering. The workshop was organised by the Erasmus+ project &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.github.io/">SusTrainable&lt;/a>, in which UvA is a partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Climate Law targets climate neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the Knowledge Economy is deemed crucial to EU prosperity. Thus, the energy footprint of software services remains an important topic of research and education. In these lecture notes, we set out to educate students on energy-aware software engineering. We show how to establish whether some programming languages are inherently more “green”. We also show how to assess whether established software smells (anti-patterns) are also energy-related smells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering master student Nuria Bruch wins VERSEN Master Thesis Award!</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nuria Bruch, supervised by Ana Oprescu, Miroslav Zivkovic and Lodewijk Bergmans wins the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sig_eu/status/1525150139614171138">VERSEN Master Thesis Award&lt;/a> for her work on &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4280883#.YtqQxdJByV5">measuring the degree of library dependency!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usage of libraries, both commercial and open-source, encapsulating the implementation of certain functionalities is a widespread practice among developers. However, when a developer uses a library in a software product, this creates a dependency, and if a library has a security issue, it can be propagated to the software product. Developers can use package managers, however, these generally offer a simple binary evaluation of the dependencies: either there is one or not. Hence, a detailed evaluation of the dependencies is missing, which could help developers deal with vulnerabilities, breaking changes, and deprecated dependencies. Nuria proposes a model for software dependencies, which can help provide a fine-grained evaluation of them. The model includes three types of metrics: coupling, coverage, and usage per class. For each metric in the model, Nuria provides a formal definition and a theoretical validation by proving the metrics’ properties. She additionally implemented a proof-of-concept tool that, given a library from the Maven Central Repository, calculates the metrics of the model for each of the dependencies using bytecode analysis. Moreover, the proof-of-concept includes a visualisation of the dependency tree, including the calculated metrics. Finally, she conducted experiments to validate the model, the implementation of the proof-of-concept, and the visualisation. The experiments include interviews with 15 professional developers who evaluated the clarity and actionability of the model’s metrics and the proposed visualisations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SusTrainable summer school</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.uniri.hr/">Rijeka SusTrainable summer school&lt;/a> (4-8 July 2022, Rijeka, Croatia) organised by the Erasmus+ project SusTrainable Ana Oprescu gave a lecture on the methodologies employed for Energy-driven Software Engineering research.

The monitoring, control and enforcement processes applied to these systems are currently to a large extent manual, which we rather automate by embedding the processes as dedicated and adaptable software services in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness. This approach requires such regulatory services to be closely aligned with a formal description of the relevant norms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>eFLINT&lt;/b> is a domain-specific language developed for formalizing norms from a variety of sources. The theoretical foundations of the language are found in transition systems and in Hohfeld’s framework of legal fundamental conceptions. The language can be used to formalize norms from a large variety of sources. The resulting specifications are executable and support several forms of reasoning such as automatic case assessment, manual exploration and simulation. Moreover, the specifications can be used to develop regulatory services for several types of monitoring, control and enforcement. The language is evaluated through a case study formalizing articles 6(1)(a) and 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A prototype implementation of eflint is discussed and is available online &lt;a href="http://grotius.uvalight.net/eflintonline/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Erasmus+</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/erasmus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/erasmus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>FogProtect</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SLICES</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/slices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/slices/</guid><description/></item><item><title>VISION</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/vision/</guid><description/></item><item><title>eFLINT: a domain-specific language for executable norm specifications</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrating Agent-Based Modelling with Copula Theory: Preliminary Insights and Open Problems</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/krzhizhanovskaya-integrating-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/krzhizhanovskaya-integrating-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrating CP-Nets in Reactive BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2019_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2019_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Managing Effective Collaboration in Cybersecurity Alliances Using Social Computational Trust</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Big Data Platforms and Tools for Data Analytics in the Data Science Engineering Curriculum</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-big-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-big-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Data Market Architecture and Functional Components</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Designing Customisable Data Science Curriculum Using Ontology for Data Science Competences and Body of Knowledge</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DL4LD</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/dl4ld/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/dl4ld/</guid><description>&lt;p>The DL4lD research project aims to help the Dutch logistics sector with digitalisation of their busines processes. To do so, DL4LD focuses on the trustworthy sharing of an organizations (potentially sensitive) data. Trust that the organization’s (potentially sensitive) data is handled in a controlled and secure way, is for many organizations a prerequisite sine qua non the organization may not be prepared to share its data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A focal point of the DL4LD research is on maintaining sovereignty by the data owner over the access, usage, processing and proliferation of his data DL4LD shows how to digitally support sufficient trust and sovereignty enablers to establish a trustworthy data sharing relationship between two logistic partners that didn&amp;rsquo;t have so a priori.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DL4LD-project runs from January 2018 to December 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EPI</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/epi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/epi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Knowledge is power &amp;ndash; and in healthcare, that holds absolutely true. Yet, for an industry that is under financial stress, increasing complexity of disease and co-morbidity, and burdened by capacity constraints &amp;ndash; why has data not been healthcare&amp;rsquo;s savvier? Three major challenges have inhibited this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>data is not accessible and remains in silos;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data is not analysed to derive meaningful clinical insights;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>insight isn&amp;rsquo;t accessible for actioning by providers or patients to self/joint manage their condition.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Our consortium of medical professionals, data scientists, IT-infrastructure experts, machine learning researchers and legal experts have designed Enabling Patient Interventions to liberate, analyse, and action that data in a trustworthy way. EPI aims to empower patients and providers through self-management, shared management, and personalization across the full health spectrum. To do so, we will build a fuller picture of the person by linking traditional eHealth data sets with new sources of data. Further, we will develop a platform based upon a secure and trustworthy distributed data infrastructure, combining data analytics, including machine learning, and health decision support algorithms to create new, actionable, and personalized insights for prevention, management, and intervention to providers and patients. We will develop new machine learning methods for determining and analysing optimal interventions within small patient groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our insights will be applied in healthcare use cases representing a spectrum of health management challenges ranging from common chronic to highly lethal orphan diseases, and will empower better self/joint management of these conditions to improve cost, quality, and outcomes of care.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSPDDP</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/sspddp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/sspddp/</guid><description>&lt;p>This proposal concerns multidisciplinary fundamental and applied research on developing a secure, end-to-end trusted, scalable and future-proof solution for distributed dynamic data sharing across multiple logistic domains. Sharing data across organizations in a secure, trusted and policy based manner, and enforcing the agreed use of that data is a hard problem. Many partial solutions already exist in the form of platforms, standards and directives, and back office solutions, all of them aimed at sharing data with their own goals and objectives. The absence of integrated solutions is hindering the potential exploitation of fused big data. Indeed, the research line “Data security in logistics” in the call underlines the importance of integrated cryptographically secure solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our proposal, typical logistics application profiles on specific demands in security, privacy, performance and policy will be identified. The goal of the proposed research is to develop end-to-end trusted and scalable solutions for typical application profiles that allow policy enforced data sharing and analysis across multiple IT domains based on negotiation of smart multi-party contracts. To achieve our goals, we will develop and integrate techniques for secure data sharing, scalability for big data, and policy-based data sharing and analytics. The ability to form temporary business alliances relies on the ability to implement ways to keep track of business agreements and transaction information in ways trusted by community members. The agility and diversity of market players, its data sources and potential risks if data is misused, is helped by creating a commonly trusted and governed infrastructure to access and share data. Such type of infrastructure is subject of research in Compartiment 1 of this call. In this proposal we will work alongside this work in order to investigate the value that blockchain technology will bring tosharing big data assets in a big data sharing infrastructure. The ability to provided trusted information from many distributed sources, such as mobile of tablet style devices that to not have to computational power to participate in traditional blockchain approaches, is an important topic address by this work. The aim is to not only protect primary data and limit accessibility via policy, but also to secure access to the provenance trails and other meta-data that are sensitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-main-goals-of-this-project-are">The main goals of this project are:&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prove the value of distribute block chain approaches that can be applied to logistic use-cases (provided by industry partners and compartment 1 collaborators)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide a future proof cryptographic approach considering the processing power quantum computing and other high performance compute technologies may bring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide an environment allowing parties to create data sharing agreements compliant to the digital market place policy thus guaranteeing secure and trustworthy real time sharing of big data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide secure mechanisms for compliancy checking using provenance trails and audit trails, and mechanisms for dispute settlement in case of breaches.&lt;/li>
