The latest contributions are being published in three articles, which will each be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPLASH 2024&lt;/a> in Pasadena, California.
Each contribution provides a piece of the puzzle of developing large and complex software systems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/paint-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAINT&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Max Boksem and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article characterises and demonstrates a fundamentally graph-based programming environment: programs are built from explicitly-linked parts. This approach has benefits from two different, existing kinds of programming environment, which together make program parts easier to maintain and re-use.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the Soundness of Auto-completion Services for Dynamically Typed Languages
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/gpce-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPCE&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Damian FrÃ¶lich and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article presents a novel mechanism for code editors to assist programmers by auto-suggesting identifiers. The novelty is that suggestions are based on an analysis of the program that is shallow enough to be fast and language-agnostic, but deep enough to guarantee suggestions are always valid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Links: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689484.3690734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOI&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/gpce2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRE-PRINT&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cooperative Specification via Composition Control
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/sle-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SLE&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Christopher Esterhuyse and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article presents a framework for using specification languages in a context where the specifications are developed from parts by cooperating agents. Some language features that are useful for this purpose are identified, and used to improve three existing specification languages&lt;/li>

on 16-20 September in Alghero, Italy. Marco and Georgios also presented posters about their research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex and autonomous ensembles of different components that
directly cooperate to offer smart and adaptive functionalities. The &lt;a href="https://www.cpsschool.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPS Summer School&lt;/a>
is targeted at students, research scientists and R&amp;amp;D experts from academia and industry, who want
to learn about CPS engineering and applications. This year&amp;rsquo;s edition was held on the Italian island
of Sardinia, in the city of Alghero.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Governance</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/theme/governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/theme/governance/</guid><description>&lt;p>The research in this theme addresses several challenges that arise from modern service-oriented systems in which the development and operationalisation of (software) services is distributed across organisational domains. These systems have in common that parties may play different roles in the realisation of applications, e.g., providing a service (such as creating data insights), infrastructure (such as compute or storage resources), or assets (such as datasets and algorithms). In such systems, organisations wish to retain control over the usage of their resources, e.g., to limit their availability, adhere to (privacy) regulations, or to protect commercial interests. To give control to resource owners, we propose systems in which policies are used to express usage constraints, mechanisms are available to enforce these constraints, and monitoring provides the information necessary for making enforcement decisions. Data exchange systems and digital data marketplaces are the primary application context, providing motivation and specific case studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Particular challenges addressed by our work are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The expression of laws, regulations, organisational policies and contractual agreements as enforceable system-level policies. This requires policy languages bridging the gap between legal statements and system-level events and distributed usage control mechanisms for policy enforcement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The distribution of control itself: different stakeholders (users, resource owners) contribute parts of the policy and control mechanisms (besides their contribution to the application itself). How can the policies expressed at location A affect decisions made at location B, considering the desire to avoid centralisation and considering that policies themselves may be sensitive?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The automatic integration of formalised interpretations of legal sources places demands on the underlying enforcement mechanisms. Firstly, ex-post enforcement (observing and responding to violations after their occurrence) is required as not all information may be available or (interpretations of) legal sources may be conflicting. Secondly, policy decisions need to be accountable such that information on which these decisions are based (policies, meta-data, actual data) may need to be retained and may themselves by sensitive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compliance-by-design. How and to what extent can we schedule the execution of applications or reconfigure the system&amp;rsquo;s configuration to ensure compliance with identified policy requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In this research theme we develop conceptual models, algorithms, protocols, languages and (prototype) tools that address these challenges.&lt;/p>

by &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/damian-frolich/">Damian Frolich&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/">L. Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/a>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Giving auto-completion candidates for dynamically typed
languages requires complex analysis of the source code,
especially when the goal is to ensure that the completion candidates do not introduce bugs.
In this paper we introduce an approach that builds upon abstract interpretation and the
scope graph framework to obtain an over-approximation of
the name binding seen at run-time. The over-approximation
contains enough information to implement auto-completion
services such that the given suggestions do not introduce
name binding errors. To demonstrate our approach,
we compare the suggestions given by our approach with the state
of the art completion services on a subset of the Python
programming language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted at FORTE 2024</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/discotec24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/discotec24/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 20th of June, Christopher Esterhuyse and Tim Mueller presented their paper (with L.

on the novel &lt;strong>JustAct&lt;/strong> framework at the &lt;a href="https://www.discotec.org/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 DisCoTec&lt;/a> federated conference, held this year in Groningen.
JustAct lays a foundation for the automatic enforcement of policies that are changed by the users on the fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from individual consent to (inter)national laws. Verifying norm-compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some domains (e.g., healthcare), the norms themselves may be private. In contrast, standard solutions (e.g., access- and usage-control, smart contracts) reason about policies that are assumed to be public. Instead, we present a novel framework prescribing how decentralised agents decide which actions are justified, despite their partial views of the policy. Crucially, justifications are universal, e.g., accepted by future auditors. Agents establish a common notion of compliance through an (externally synchronized) agreement, which is the basis of each justification defined by policy fragments agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PhD defense of Peter Fratric</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/defense-peter-fratric/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/defense-peter-fratric/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 28 May 2024, Peter Fratric successfully defended his PhD dissertation entitled:

interact with the hardware via the operating system, and how the
operating system solves various tasks for the applications such as CPU
scheduling, and memory and storage management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding these basics is very important to analyse and tune the
performance of a system to a particular application. In the Complex
Cyber Infrastructure group, we are often dealing with very high
performance hardware, such as 400 Gbps fiber links, and large storage
volumes. To have e.g. data-processing applications make full use of this
hardware, requires tuning the operating system to the specific workload,
and this is where the fundamental operating system knowledge comes in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best paper award for article in Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/best-paper-aya/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/best-paper-aya/</guid><description>&lt;p>The article &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281723000963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assessing data remnants in modern smartphones after factory reset&lt;/a>, published in September 2023 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/forensic-science-international-digital-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation&lt;/a>, has won the &lt;strong>Best Paper Award 2023&lt;/strong>.

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase a programmersâ productivity and the safety of a program. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which domain-specific languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper we present &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em>, an extensible meta-language implemented in Haskell supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. We demonstrate &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em> through the construction of the Imp, SIMPLE, and MiniJava languages via the composition and restriction of language fragments, demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators, and demonstrate the different forms of extensions possible in &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compiler construction</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cryptographic Engineering</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/cryptographic_engineering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/cryptographic_engineering/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DevOps</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/devops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/devops/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Organisatie: analyse en ontwikkeling</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/organisatie_analyse_en_ontwikkeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/organisatie_analyse_en_ontwikkeling/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the course Organisational Analysis and Developement (in Dutch Organisatieontwikkeling and -ontwikkeling) we study how collaborations between organisations influence IT-architectures that support cross-organisational collaboration.

&lt;p>The course focuses on Secure Computation that has developed as a central tool in cryptography â This allows multiple distributed parties to jointly compute on their private inputs, with the guarantee that nothing beyond the output is revealed. The current and potential impact of secure computing is widespread across scenarios where data sharing is constrained due to legal, ethical, or privacy reasons.&lt;/p>

The primary goal of &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10565916">the document&lt;/a> is to describe the AMdEX approach to sharing data and the AMdEX reference architecture comprised of governance solutions and technical solutions. Central to the approach are the AMdEX community members that cooperate as a consortium within AMdEX dataspaces and within a certain ecosystem. This document also explains how AMdEX works in practice, both from a userâs perspective, in relation to other initiatives, and by presenting existing use cases.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In particular, this document describes:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The principles guiding the design of the AMdEX technical architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The users, roles, (technical) components and protocols that form AMdEX dataspaces and ecosystems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The administration and enforcement of policies within AMdEX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use cases from the AMdEX fieldlab project, explained in terms of the aforementioned roles and components
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
An important aspect of AMdEX is the explicit connection made between contractual agreements and applicable laws (soft infrastructure) on the one hand and the (hard) technical infrastructure on the other hand. This document describes how that connection is made and the process by which laws and contracts are integrated into the technical domain.
&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices has revolutionized many aspects of modern computing.
Experience has shown that these devices often have severe security
problems and are common targets for malware. One approach to
ensure that only trusted software is executed on these devices is
Remote Attestation, which allows a verifier to attest the integrity
of software running on such a prover device. As malware is
typically not trusted, an infected device will fail to generate a
valid signature, which allows the verifier to detect the presence
of malware on the prover. To achieve its security guarantees,
Remote Attestation requires a trust anchor, often found in the
form of dedicated hardware on the prover. For IoT and embedded
devices such hardware has only recently become largely deployed.
Modern Remote Attestation protocols rely on classical asymmetric
signatures that are vulnerable to quantum attacks, which are
expected to become feasible in the near future. Considering the
extensive usage of IoT and embedded systems combined with
their long lifetime (in some applications), it is necessary to be
able to retrofit these devices to support quantum secure Remote
Attestation without incurring a prohibitive overhead. In this paper
we present SPRAV, a software-based Remote Attestation system
that leverages the Physical Memory Protection (PMP) primitive of
RISC-V to achieve its security guarantees and employs quantum-
safe cryptographic algorithms to ensure resistance against quan-
tum attacks in the future. Our evaluation shows that it is feasible
to deploy this solution on RISC-V devices without incurring a
prohibitive overhead or the need for additional hardware, paving
the way towards quantum-resistant functionalities also in IoT.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE23</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>Adaptive Structural Operational Semantics&lt;/strong>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems evolve more and more in complex and changing environments, often requiring runtime adaptation
to best deliver their services. When self-adaptation is the
main concern of the system, a manual implementation of
the underlying feedback loop and trade-off analysis may be
desirable. However, the required expertise and substantial development effort make such implementations prohibitively
difficult when it is only a secondary concern for the given
domain. In this paper, we present ASOS, a metalanguage abstracting the runtime adaptation concern of a given domain
in the behavioral semantics of a domain-specific language
(DSL), freeing the language user from implementing it from
scratch for each system in the domain. We demonstrate our
approach on RobLANG, a procedural DSL for robotics, where
we abstract a recurrent energy-saving behavior depending
on the context. We provide formal semantics for ASOS and
pave the way for checking properties such as determinism,
completeness, and termination of the resulting self-adaptable
language. We provide first results on the performance of our
approach compared to a manual implementation of this self-
adaptable behavior. We demonstrate, for RobLANG, that our
approach provides suitable abstractions for specifying sound
adaptive operational semantics while being more efficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCI Demoing at Science Park's Open Day</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/open-day-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/open-day-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>As one of the three representing teams of our Informatics Institute at the Amsterdam

&lt;p>The increasing value of data and the emergence of programmable infrastructures have paved the way for collaborative multi-domain applications across industries such as healthcare and airlines. However, such collaborations come with significant challenges, including application coordination, incentivization, and validation of execution. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that leverages blockchain technology and utilizes Petri nets for workflow modeling. Our approach involves implementing a smart contract-based workflow coordinator on the blockchain and employing a three-layered architecture to coordinate off-chain tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Petri nets for modeling economy tokens, which serve as incentives to foster collaboration among workflow parties. To validate our solution, we present a proof of concept through a simulated use case involving a multi-domain workflow for mitigating a DDoS attack. In this use case, domains collaborate by blocking offending IPs, incentivized by acquired tokens required to invoke workflows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Published@AMC 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-amc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-amc/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>The dynamics of corruption under an optional external supervision service&lt;/b> by Xin Zhou, Adam Belloum, Michael H.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>External supervision services play an important role in combating corruption by detecting potential collusive bribery. This work aims at studying the dynamics of collusive bribery when participants have the option of engaging the external supervision services. To do so, we construct a basic model where collusive bribery can happen between the defecting participants who aim to escape from a punishment by offering a bribe to rule enforcers who monitor interactions among all participants. Among rule enforcers, only the corrupt ones accept the bribe and ignore the violations. The cooperative participants can engage the external supervision service at a certain cost to avoid the risk of potential collusive bribery. Under the framework of evolutionary game theory, we find that a higher initial fraction of honest enforcers is more likely to lead to a trusting cooperating equilibrium. We also find that, when allowing random exploration of available strategies, increasing the exploration rate of rule enforcers is effective in combating corruption for both infinite and finite populations. Lastly, we find that minimizing the cost of external supervision services is not always good. When the system evolves into a cooperating equilibrium, a low cost of external supervision service induces unnecessary costs of seeking external supervision. When the strategy profiles exhibit stable oscillations, there exists an optimal cost of external supervision, considering the trade-off between minimizing the chance of exposing cooperative participants to collusive bribery and strengthening the punishment on the corrupt enforcers. Premised on the results, we discuss practical management suggestions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best Short Paper Award at CompSys 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/compsys-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/compsys-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LargeResearch/status/1674378448763072513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo&lt;/a>

&lt;h1 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Encryption is a method to keep our data safe from third parties. However,
side-channel information may be leaked during encryption due to physical
properties. This information can be used in side-channel attacks to recover
critical values such as the secret encryption key. To this end, it is necessary
to understand the robustness of implementations to assess the security of data
handled by a device. Side-channel attacks are one such method which allow
researchers to evaluate the robustness of implementations using appropriate
metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the security community, machine learning is playing a
prominent role in the study of side-channel attacks. A notable
example of this is the use of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE)
as a preprocessing step on the measurements. In this work
we study in depth the problem of finding the most suitable
architecture of such Convolutional Autoencoders. To this end,
Optuna is used to explore the CAE hyperparameter space. This
process allows us to identify hyperparameters that outperform
state-of-the-art autoencoders, reducing the needed traces for
a succesful attack by approximately 37% in the presence of
Gaussian noise and reducing the trainable parameters needed
to attack desynchronization by a factor of 29. In addition to the
promising results, experiments carried out in this paper allow
a better understanding of the hyperparameter space in the field
of side channel attacks, providing a solid base for future use of
CAE in this specific domain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Published at ACM Computing Surveys</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-csur/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-csur/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper &amp;lsquo;A Survey on Thwarting Memory Corruption in RISC-V&amp;rsquo;, authored by

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With embedded devices becoming more pervasive and entrenched in society, it is
paramount to keep these systems secure. A threat plaguing these systems consists
of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing
an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but
suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be
mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware,
we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored
for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses
beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting
memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the
security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software
and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair
comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current
implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively
small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still
required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows,
to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards,
resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more
harmonized evaluation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Just happened: Programming Languages in the Netherlands (PLNL) 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/plnl-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/plnl-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>The workshop Programming Languages in the Netherlands, supported by &lt;a href="https://versen.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VERSEN&lt;/a>, was a big success.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) Inference in Edge Computing, often coined Edge Intelligence, requires solutions to insure that
sensitive data confidentiality and intellectual property are not revealed in the process. Privacy-preserving Edge Intelligence
is only emerging, despite the growing prevalence of Edge Computing as a context of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service. Solutions have
yet to be applied to state-of-the-art DNNs. This position paper provides an original assessment of the compatibility of existing
techniques for privacy-preserving DNN Inference with the characteristics of an Edge Computing setup. The resulting favorite
candidate is secret sharing. We then address the future role of model compression methods in the research towards secret sharing
on DNNs with state-of-the-art performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assistant or Associate Professor in Security and Privacy</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2023-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2023-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Join our team!

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @JURIX2022</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>Can a military autonomous device follow International Humanitarian Law?&lt;/b> by Tomasz Zurek, Jonathan Kwik, Mostafa Mohajeriparizi and Tom Van Engers was accepted at &lt;a href="https://jurix2022.rechtsinformatik.saarland/">&lt;b>35th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems&lt;/b>&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>iCoLa: A Compositional Meta-language with Support for Incremental Language Development&lt;/strong>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase programming productivity and safety. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which specialized languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. Finally, we demonstrate iCoLa through a case-study in which we construct &lt;em>Imp&lt;/em>, &lt;em>SIMPLE&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>MiniJava&lt;/em> through the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open PhD position</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2022-09/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/vacancy-2022-09/</guid><description>&lt;p>Is it possible to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning, while increasing its security and privacy?

Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam &amp;mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities.
&lt;img src="8P9A9066.JPG" alt="Early birds">&lt;/p>
&lt;p align = "center">
Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat.
The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events.
One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the
Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was
hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat
went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center" style="display: inline-block;">
&lt;img src="8P9A9073.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9079.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist.
Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9101.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9128.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks.
&lt;img src="8P9A9299.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9223.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9333.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time
to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/ana-oprescu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana&lt;/a> and her entourage on to the boat.
But first, there were two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/daphnee-chabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daphne&lt;/a>, taking the opportunity to swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="8P9A9424.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made.

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around &lt;i>normative advisors&lt;/i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Master Software Engineering student papers accepted at BENEVOLâ22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/papers-accepted-at-benevol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bas van den Brinkâs work on applying model-based testing to microservices has been accepted as a proceedings contribution to &lt;a href=

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
ââEuropean Union has aggregated the current societal concerns into two seemingly orthogonal directions: the Green Deal and the GDPR. In this paper, we begin to analyse trade-offs in preserving privacy, learning from the data, and saving energy. Considerable research studied the energy efficiency of software and the accuracy of machine learning models trained on anonymised datasets. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the impact of anonymisation techniques on energy consumption. We measure the impact of anonymisation on the energy consumption and on the accuracy of machine learning models.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
We find that the k-value has a statistically significant impact on the energy consumption of the chosen anonymization algorithms. In terms of the accuracy of machine learning models, the generalisation and suppression performs better in almost all cases, provided that proper anonymization hierarchies are used in the anonymization process. However, we find that for the larger and more complex dataset, the reduction in accuracy is limited while there is a significant difference in energy consumption. Thus when considering energy consumption we conclude that for larger datasets it might be worthwhile to consider using microaggregation over generalisation and suppression.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the same event, Lukas Koedijk also presented the &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9830107/">paper&lt;/a> co-authored with Ana Oprescu based on his master graduation project on the Energy Footprint of Programming Languages. Lukas is an alumnus of the Software Engineering master, now working at KPMG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Green Deal mirrors the societal concern regarding climate change. In the software industry this means reducing the energy consumption of a program. This can be done by looking both at the hardware and the software used. We take a software approach and focus on the programming language choices and how a computer program is written. The programming languages we investigate are Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C++ and C#. We compare programs from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game and these programs are divided in groups that solve the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that the choice of programming language and the way of writing your program influences the energy consumption. The programming languages that consume the least amount of energy over all the problems are C and C++, albeit these programming languages consume more energy when compilation flags are minimized. However, in some cases we could not prove that there was a difference in the energy consumption. We also find that the hardware used to run the programs has an influence on the energy consumption. We find that the runtime of a program correlates with the energy consumption, but a shorter runtime does not necessarily result in a lower energy consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the colocated &lt;a href="https://gsd.web.elte.hu/events/sustrainable">SusTrainable workshop&lt;/a>, Ana also presented current research efforts on Energy-driven Software Engineering. The workshop was organised by the Erasmus+ project &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.github.io/">SusTrainable&lt;/a>, in which UvA is a partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU Climate Law targets climate neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the Knowledge Economy is deemed crucial to EU prosperity. Thus, the energy footprint of software services remains an important topic of research and education. In these lecture notes, we set out to educate students on energy-aware software engineering. We show how to establish whether some programming languages are inherently more âgreenâ. We also show how to assess whether established software smells (anti-patterns) are also energy-related smells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering master student Nuria Bruch wins VERSEN Master Thesis Award!</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/nuria-versen-award/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nuria Bruch, supervised by Ana Oprescu, Miroslav Zivkovic and Lodewijk Bergmans wins the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sig_eu/status/1525150139614171138">VERSEN Master Thesis Award&lt;/a> for her work on &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4280883#.YtqQxdJByV5">measuring the degree of library dependency!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usage of libraries, both commercial and open-source, encapsulating the implementation of certain functionalities is a widespread practice among developers. However, when a developer uses a library in a software product, this creates a dependency, and if a library has a security issue, it can be propagated to the software product. Developers can use package managers, however, these generally offer a simple binary evaluation of the dependencies: either there is one or not. Hence, a detailed evaluation of the dependencies is missing, which could help developers deal with vulnerabilities, breaking changes, and deprecated dependencies. Nuria proposes a model for software dependencies, which can help provide a fine-grained evaluation of them. The model includes three types of metrics: coupling, coverage, and usage per class. For each metric in the model, Nuria provides a formal definition and a theoretical validation by proving the metricsâ properties. She additionally implemented a proof-of-concept tool that, given a library from the Maven Central Repository, calculates the metrics of the model for each of the dependencies using bytecode analysis. Moreover, the proof-of-concept includes a visualisation of the dependency tree, including the calculated metrics. Finally, she conducted experiments to validate the model, the implementation of the proof-of-concept, and the visualisation. The experiments include interviews with 15 professional developers who evaluated the clarity and actionability of the modelâs metrics and the proposed visualisations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SusTrainable summer school</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/ana-presented-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the &lt;a href="https://sustrainable.uniri.hr/">Rijeka SusTrainable summer school&lt;/a> (4-8 July 2022, Rijeka, Croatia) organised by the Erasmus+ project SusTrainable Ana Oprescu gave a lecture on the methodologies employed for Energy-driven Software Engineering research.

The practical applicability of the new UML profile is demonstrated with the use cases of the EU-funded research project FogProtect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change of Group Leadership</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/change-leader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/change-leader/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of 1 June 2022, leadership of the Complex Cyber Infrastructure research group was transferred from Prof. Cees de Laat to Dr. Zoltan Mann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/cees-de-laat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof.dr.ir. Cees de Laat&lt;/a> chaired the System and Network Engineering (SNE) research group since 2006. SNE became so large that on his proposal it was split into three successful research groups in 2020: Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI), the Multiscale Networked Systems (MNS), and Parallel Computing Systems (PCS) research groups. Prof. de Laat chaired CCI since the split. His retirement is coming up later this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Zoltan Mann&lt;/a> is an experienced researcher, who is committed to lead CCI to a further successful future, leveraging his international research and teaching background and industrial leadership experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prof. de Laat and dr. Mann will continue to closely work together to make the transition as smooth as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preference-Based Goal Refinement in BDI

The monitoring, control and enforcement processes applied to these systems are currently to a large extent manual, which we rather automate by embedding the processes as dedicated and adaptable software services in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness. This approach requires such regulatory services to be closely aligned with a formal description of the relevant norms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>eFLINT&lt;/b> is a domain-specific language developed for formalizing norms from a variety of sources. The theoretical foundations of the language are found in transition systems and in Hohfeldâs framework of legal fundamental conceptions. The language can be used to formalize norms from a large variety of sources. The resulting specifications are executable and support several forms of reasoning such as automatic case assessment, manual exploration and simulation. Moreover, the specifications can be used to develop regulatory services for several types of monitoring, control and enforcement. The language is evaluated through a case study formalizing articles 6(1)(a) and 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A prototype implementation of eflint is discussed and is available online &lt;a href="http://grotius.uvalight.net/eflintonline/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Erasmus+</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/erasmus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/erasmus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>FogProtect</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SLICES</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/slices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/slices/</guid><description/></item><item><title>VISION</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/vision/</guid><description/></item><item><title>eFLINT: a domain-specific language for executable norm specifications</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrating Agent-Based Modelling with Copula Theory: Preliminary Insights and Open Problems</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/krzhizhanovskaya-integrating-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/krzhizhanovskaya-integrating-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrating CP-Nets in Reactive BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2019_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2019_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Managing Effective Collaboration in Cybersecurity Alliances Using Social Computational Trust</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Big Data Platforms and Tools for Data Analytics in the Data Science Engineering Curriculum</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-big-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-big-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Data Market Architecture and Functional Components</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Designing Customisable Data Science Curriculum Using Ontology for Data Science Competences and Body of Knowledge</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-designing-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>DL4LD</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/dl4ld/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/dl4ld/</guid><description>&lt;p>The DL4lD research project aims to help the Dutch logistics sector with digitalisation of their busines processes.

&lt;p>A focal point of the DL4LD research is on maintaining sovereignty by the data owner over the access, usage, processing and proliferation of his data DL4LD shows how to digitally support sufficient trust and sovereignty enablers to establish a trustworthy data sharing relationship between two logistic partners that didn&amp;rsquo;t have so a priori.&lt;/p>

Yet, for an industry that is under financial stress, increasing complexity of disease and co-morbidity, and burdened by capacity constraints &amp;ndash; why has data not been healthcare&amp;rsquo;s savvier? Three major challenges have inhibited this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>data is not accessible and remains in silos;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data is not analysed to derive meaningful clinical insights;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>insight isn&amp;rsquo;t accessible for actioning by providers or patients to self/joint manage their condition.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Our consortium of medical professionals, data scientists, IT-infrastructure experts, machine learning researchers and legal experts have designed Enabling Patient Interventions to liberate, analyse, and action that data in a trustworthy way. EPI aims to empower patients and providers through self-management, shared management, and personalization across the full health spectrum. To do so, we will build a fuller picture of the person by linking traditional eHealth data sets with new sources of data. Further, we will develop a platform based upon a secure and trustworthy distributed data infrastructure, combining data analytics, including machine learning, and health decision support algorithms to create new, actionable, and personalized insights for prevention, management, and intervention to providers and patients. We will develop new machine learning methods for determining and analysing optimal interventions within small patient groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our insights will be applied in healthcare use cases representing a spectrum of health management challenges ranging from common chronic to highly lethal orphan diseases, and will empower better self/joint management of these conditions to improve cost, quality, and outcomes of care.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSPDDP</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/project/sspddp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/project/sspddp/</guid><description>&lt;p>This proposal concerns multidisciplinary fundamental and applied research on developing a secure, end-to-end trusted, scalable and future-proof solution for distributed dynamic data sharing across multiple logistic domains. Sharing data across organizations in a secure, trusted and policy based manner, and enforcing the agreed use of that data is a hard problem. Many partial solutions already exist in the form of platforms, standards and directives, and back office solutions, all of them aimed at sharing data with their own goals and objectives. The absence of integrated solutions is hindering the potential exploitation of fused big data. Indeed, the research line âData security in logisticsâ in the call underlines the importance of integrated cryptographically secure solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our proposal, typical logistics application profiles on specific demands in security, privacy, performance and policy will be identified. The goal of the proposed research is to develop end-to-end trusted and scalable solutions for typical application profiles that allow policy enforced data sharing and analysis across multiple IT domains based on negotiation of smart multi-party contracts. To achieve our goals, we will develop and integrate techniques for secure data sharing, scalability for big data, and policy-based data sharing and analytics. The ability to form temporary business alliances relies on the ability to implement ways to keep track of business agreements and transaction information in ways trusted by community members. The agility and diversity of market players, its data sources and potential risks if data is misused, is helped by creating a commonly trusted and governed infrastructure to access and share data. Such type of infrastructure is subject of research in Compartiment 1 of this call. In this proposal we will work alongside this work in order to investigate the value that blockchain technology will bring tosharing big data assets in a big data sharing infrastructure. The ability to provided trusted information from many distributed sources, such as mobile of tablet style devices that to not have to computational power to participate in traditional blockchain approaches, is an important topic address by this work. The aim is to not only protect primary data and limit accessibility via policy, but also to secure access to the provenance trails and other meta-data that are sensitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-main-goals-of-this-project-are">The main goals of this project are:&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prove the value of distribute block chain approaches that can be applied to logistic use-cases (provided by industry partners and compartment 1 collaborators)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide a future proof cryptographic approach considering the processing power quantum computing and other high performance compute technologies may bring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide an environment allowing parties to create data sharing agreements compliant to the digital market place policy thus guaranteeing secure and trustworthy real time sharing of big data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide secure mechanisms for compliancy checking using provenance trails and audit trails, and mechanisms for dispute settlement in case of breaches.&lt;/li>
