The main motivation is to protect personal data and comply with data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The course&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>explains the context of data protection technologies from multiple angles (e.g., legal requirements, interplay with other quality attributes);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conveys in-depth knowledge on some specific data protection technologies (e.g., cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, anonymization and pseudonymization, differential privacy, access control, anonymous communications);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>showcases applications of data protection technologies (in particular, privacy-preserving machine learning and location privacy).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The course is closely linked to the research performed by CCI researchers in the field of security and privacy (for example, in the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/secured/">SECURED&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect">FogProtect&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/epi">EPI&lt;/a> projects).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
