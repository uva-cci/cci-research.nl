interact with the hardware via the operating system, and how the
operating system solves various tasks for the applications such as CPU
scheduling, and memory and storage management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding these basics is very important to analyse and tune the
performance of a system to a particular application. In the Complex
Cyber Infrastructure group, we are often dealing with very high
performance hardware, such as 400 Gbps fiber links, and large storage
volumes. To have e.g. data-processing applications make full use of this
hardware, requires tuning the operating system to the specific workload,
and this is where the fundamental operating system knowledge comes in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Classical Cryptography</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/classical_cryptography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/classical_cryptography/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Compiler construction</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/compiler_construction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Programmeertalen</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/programmeertalen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/programmeertalen/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Web and Media Tech</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/web_and_media_tech/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/web_and_media_tech/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Introduction to Security</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/introduction_to_security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/introduction_to_security/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
