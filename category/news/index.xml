Experimental Studies -preparation project (SLICES-PP) is a project with
25 partners and a budget of 3 M€ for 4 years. The UvA will receive 303
K€ and it will be led by Yuri Demchenko of the Informatics Institute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demchenko, from the CCI (Complex Cyber Infrastructure) group, will
coordinate two topics in SLICES-PP, first Research Data Management in
the SLICES infrastructure, and secondly SLICES capacity building and
career management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a part of activities in SLICES-PP, UvA will also facilitate creating
a SLICES-NL community and involving Dutch research organizations and
universities. The goal is to define the research agenda for SLICES-NL
and coordinate efforts to obtain national funding. In this connection,
new SLICES-NL coordination meetings will be organised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SLICES as a European Research Infrastructure aims to make a fundamental
contribution to research and innovation in digital sciences and
infrastructures, future Internet technologies, future smart networks and
services by providing high quality experimentation services with
emerging technologies around the area of digital sciences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new research infrastructure will allow academics and industry to
experiment and test future, possibly disruptive digital technologies,
essential for European research. This infrastructure can be beneficial
for other scientific and engineering domains, such as smart cities,
energy, green technologies and healthcare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SLICES-PP will coordinate the preparatory stage to build the future
SLICES Research Infrastructure for Digital Technologies experimentation.
The project was submitted by consortium of 25 research institutions and
centers from 15 countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SLICES-RI (Research Infrastructure) is included in the ESFRI Roadmap
2021 as a new RI for digital technologies experimentation, together with
other already existing RI and e-Infrastructures.&lt;/p>

The paper, authored by &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoltan Mann&lt;/a> with co-authors from the University of Duisburg-Essen, presents a new UML profile for improved modeling of data protection aspects in edge computing systems.
The practical applicability of the new UML profile is demonstrated with the use cases of the EU-funded research project FogProtect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change of Group Leadership</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/change-leader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/change-leader/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of 1 June 2022, leadership of the Complex Cyber Infrastructure research group was transferred from Prof. Cees de Laat to Dr. Zoltan Mann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/cees-de-laat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof.dr.ir. Cees de Laat&lt;/a> chaired the System and Network Engineering (SNE) research group since 2006. SNE became so large that on his proposal it was split into three successful research groups in 2020: Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI), the Multiscale Networked Systems (MNS), and Parallel Computing Systems (PCS) research groups. Prof. de Laat chaired CCI since the split. His retirement is coming up later this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Zoltan Mann&lt;/a> is an experienced researcher, who is committed to lead CCI to a further successful future, leveraging his international research and teaching background and industrial leadership experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prof. de Laat and dr. Mann will continue to closely work together to make the transition as smooth as possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
