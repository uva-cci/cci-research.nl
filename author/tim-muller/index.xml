look-alikes with fellow members of the MNS and PCS research groups from our SNE
cluster, managed to conquer the 11th place. A very nice result for the first
particpation, which we could not have achieved without our dedicated SNE
supporters that kept cheering for us until the very end. A special thanks to you!&lt;/p>

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We report on the ideas and experiences of adapting Brane, a workflow execution framework, for use cases involving medical
data exchange and processing. These use cases impose new requirements on the system to enforce policies encoding safety
properties, ranging from access control to legal regulations pertaining to data privacy. Our approach emphasizes users' control
over the extent to which they cooperate in distributed execution, at the cost of revealing information about their policies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
