&lt;em>Snelle Jelle and the Daltons&lt;/em> featuring among others CCI members Tim, Damian,
Christopher and Marco, won the &lt;strong>Most Cheerful Outfit&lt;/strong> prize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Out of the 16 teams participating, the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5659248/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>The Daltons&lt;/em>&lt;/a>
look-alikes with fellow members of the MNS and PCS research groups from our SNE
cluster, managed to conquer the 11th place. A very nice result for the first
particpation, which we could not have achieved without our dedicated SNE
supporters that kept cheering for us until the very end. A special thanks to you!&lt;/p>

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We report on the ideas and experiences of adapting Brane, a workflow execution framework, for use cases involving medical
data exchange and processing. These use cases impose new requirements on the system to enforce policies encoding safety
properties, ranging from access control to legal regulations pertaining to data privacy. Our approach emphasizes users' control
over the extent to which they cooperate in distributed execution, at the cost of revealing information about their policies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted at FORTE 2024</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/discotec24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/discotec24/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 20th of June, Christopher Esterhuyse and Tim Mueller presented their paper (with L. Thomas van Binsbergen)
on the novel &lt;strong>JustAct&lt;/strong> framework at the &lt;a href="https://www.discotec.org/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 DisCoTec&lt;/a> federated conference, held this year in Groningen.
JustAct lays a foundation for the automatic enforcement of policies that are changed by the users on the fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from individual consent to (inter)national laws. Verifying norm-compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some domains (e.g., healthcare), the norms themselves may be private. In contrast, standard solutions (e.g., access- and usage-control, smart contracts) reason about policies that are assumed to be public. Instead, we present a novel framework prescribing how decentralised agents decide which actions are justified, despite their partial views of the policy. Crucially, justifications are universal, e.g., accepted by future auditors. Agents establish a common notion of compliance through an (externally synchronized) agreement, which is the basis of each justification defined by policy fragments agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
