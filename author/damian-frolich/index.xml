&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>iCoLa: A Compositional Meta-language with Support for Incremental Language Development&lt;/strong>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase programming productivity and safety. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which specialized languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. Finally, we demonstrate iCoLa through a case-study in which we construct &lt;em>Imp&lt;/em>, &lt;em>SIMPLE&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>MiniJava&lt;/em> through the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Markermeer: the CCI social event</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/social-event-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/social-event-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>To end the academic year in style, the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complex Cyber Infrastructure&lt;/a> group went on a sailing trip on the Markermeer.
Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam &amp;mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities.

Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat.
The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events.
One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the
Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was
hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat
went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist.
Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="8P9A9128.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks.

&lt;img src="8P9A9333.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time
to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/ana-oprescu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana&lt;/a> and her entourage on to the boat.
But first, there were two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/daphnee-chabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daphne&lt;/a>, taking the opportunity to swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made.
