&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase a programmers’ productivity and the safety of a program. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which domain-specific languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper we present &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em>, an extensible meta-language implemented in Haskell supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. We demonstrate &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em> through the construction of the Imp, SIMPLE, and MiniJava languages via the composition and restriction of language fragments, demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators, and demonstrate the different forms of extensions possible in &lt;em>iCoLa+&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE23</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle23/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>Adaptive Structural Operational Semantics&lt;/strong>

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems evolve more and more in complex and changing environments, often requiring runtime adaptation
to best deliver their services. When self-adaptation is the
main concern of the system, a manual implementation of
the underlying feedback loop and trade-off analysis may be
desirable. However, the required expertise and substantial development effort make such implementations prohibitively
difficult when it is only a secondary concern for the given
domain. In this paper, we present ASOS, a metalanguage abstracting the runtime adaptation concern of a given domain
in the behavioral semantics of a domain-specific language
(DSL), freeing the language user from implementing it from
scratch for each system in the domain. We demonstrate our
approach on RobLANG, a procedural DSL for robotics, where
we abstract a recurrent energy-saving behavior depending
on the context. We provide formal semantics for ASOS and
pave the way for checking properties such as determinism,
completeness, and termination of the resulting self-adaptable
language. We provide first results on the performance of our
approach compared to a manual implementation of this self-
adaptable behavior. We demonstrate, for RobLANG, that our
approach provides suitable abstractions for specifying sound
adaptive operational semantics while being more efficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SNE Volleybal Team Outshines Competition</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/fnwi-volleybal-2023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/fnwi-volleybal-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Participating at the Faculty of Science&amp;rsquo;s annual volleybal tournament, Team

&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @SLE22</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-at-sle22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;strong>iCoLa: A Compositional Meta-language with Support for Incremental Language Development&lt;/strong>

&lt;p>Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase programming productivity and safety. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which specialized languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. Finally, we demonstrate iCoLa through a case-study in which we construct &lt;em>Imp&lt;/em>, &lt;em>SIMPLE&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>MiniJava&lt;/em> through the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Markermeer: the CCI social event</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/social-event-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/social-event-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>To end the academic year in style, the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complex Cyber Infrastructure&lt;/a> group went on a sailing trip on the Markermeer.
Before the sailing trip could take off, the group needed to gather in the harbour of Monnickendam &amp;mdash; a beautiful old city with plenty of sightseeing and picture opportunities.

Waiting in the harbour for all members to arrive
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After everyone arrived in the harbour, the captain gave a bit of history on the boat.
The boat was several centuries old, had different owners over time and experienced a couple of world events.
One such event is the second world-war. Since the boat can reach shallow water, it was of upmost interest to the
Germans, because it could be used to supply soldiers on beaches. To prevent usage by the Germans, the boat was
hidden in the Biesbosch during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some new knowledge on our hands, the sailing trip started. Before sailing with the sails, the boat
went out of the harbour using an engine. This gave todays pirates time to fill their bellies before their labour was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center" style="display: inline-block;">

&lt;img src="8P9A9079.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived on open water, we could set sail. However, first the sails needed to be hoist.
Several strong members of the group volunteered for this activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p float="center">
&lt;img src="8P9A9101.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9128.JPG" width="48%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sails hoisted and a good wind, it was time to relax, socialise and enjoy a couple of drinks.
&lt;img src="8P9A9299.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="8P9A9223.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;"/>
&lt;img src="8P9A9333.JPG" width="49%" style="display: inline;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a beautiful couple of hours on the water while catching some good winds, it was time
to return to the harbour for a nice barbeque and to welcome &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/ana-oprescu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana&lt;/a> and her entourage on to the boat.
But first, there were two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/l.-thomas-van-binsbergen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/daphnee-chabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daphne&lt;/a>, taking the opportunity to swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="8P9A9424.JPG" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it was a great day and being on a sailing boat was a new experience for some. Interesting conversations and discussions were held and new friendships were made.
