&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Enforceable Contracts (DEC): Making Smart Contracts Smarter</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/villata-digital-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/villata-digital-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>eFLINT: a domain-specific language for executable norm specifications</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-eflint-2020/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
