&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The increasing value of data and the emergence of programmable infrastructures have paved the way for collaborative multi-domain applications across industries such as healthcare and airlines. However, such collaborations come with significant challenges, including application coordination, incentivization, and validation of execution. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that leverages blockchain technology and utilizes Petri nets for workflow modeling. Our approach involves implementing a smart contract-based workflow coordinator on the blockchain and employing a three-layered architecture to coordinate off-chain tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Petri nets for modeling economy tokens, which serve as incentives to foster collaboration among workflow parties. To validate our solution, we present a proof of concept through a simulated use case involving a multi-domain workflow for mitigating a DDoS attack. In this use case, domains collaborate by blocking offending IPs, incentivized by acquired tokens required to invoke workflows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Published@AMC 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-amc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-amc/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>The dynamics of corruption under an optional external supervision service&lt;/b> by Xin Zhou, Adam Belloum, Michael H.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>External supervision services play an important role in combating corruption by detecting potential collusive bribery. This work aims at studying the dynamics of collusive bribery when participants have the option of engaging the external supervision services. To do so, we construct a basic model where collusive bribery can happen between the defecting participants who aim to escape from a punishment by offering a bribe to rule enforcers who monitor interactions among all participants. Among rule enforcers, only the corrupt ones accept the bribe and ignore the violations. The cooperative participants can engage the external supervision service at a certain cost to avoid the risk of potential collusive bribery. Under the framework of evolutionary game theory, we find that a higher initial fraction of honest enforcers is more likely to lead to a trusting cooperating equilibrium. We also find that, when allowing random exploration of available strategies, increasing the exploration rate of rule enforcers is effective in combating corruption for both infinite and finite populations. Lastly, we find that minimizing the cost of external supervision services is not always good. When the system evolves into a cooperating equilibrium, a low cost of external supervision service induces unnecessary costs of seeking external supervision. When the strategy profiles exhibit stable oscillations, there exists an optimal cost of external supervision, considering the trade-off between minimizing the chance of exposing cooperative participants to collusive bribery and strengthening the punishment on the corrupt enforcers. Premised on the results, we discuss practical management suggestions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inter-faculty UvA funding success for CCI projects</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/rdt-projects-2023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/rdt-projects-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please find &lt;a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/news/2023/05/theme-based-collaboration-enters-next-phase-with-awarding-of-midsize-projects-and-seed-grants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this&lt;/a> announcement on the internal (UvA) funding awarded for interdisciplinary research within certain themes.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @JURIX2022</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>Can a military autonomous device follow International Humanitarian Law?&lt;/b> by Tomasz Zurek, Jonathan Kwik, Mostafa Mohajeriparizi and Tom Van Engers was accepted at &lt;a href="https://jurix2022.rechtsinformatik.saarland/">&lt;b>35th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems&lt;/b>&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around &lt;i>normative advisors&lt;/i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Costly incentives design from an institutional perspective: cooperation, sustainability and affluence</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/proceeding_a_xin_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/proceeding_a_xin_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Preference-Based Goal Refinement in BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/aamas_2022_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/aamas_2022_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dynamic generation of access control policies from social policies</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-dynamic-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-binsbergen-dynamic-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Promises and pitfalls of computational modelling for insurgency conflicts</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-der-zwet-promises-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/van-der-zwet-promises-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Algorithmic fog of war: When lack of transparency violates the law of armed conflict</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/kwik-algorithmic-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/kwik-algorithmic-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Seamless Integration and Testing for MAS Engineering</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/emas_2021_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/emas_2021_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Critical Reflection on ODRL</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/rodriguez-doncel-critical-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/rodriguez-doncel-critical-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Digital Enforceable Contracts (DEC): Making Smart Contracts Smarter</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/villata-digital-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/villata-digital-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Policy Enforcement for Secure and Trustworthy Data Sharing in Multi-domain Infrastructures</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/zhou-policy-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/zhou-policy-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Declarative Preferences in Reactive BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2020_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2020_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Run, Agent, Run!
