&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software systems are expected to comply with norms from a variety of sources. However, the increasing volume and the dynamism of norms make it rather difficult to have a fully compliant software system by design. This paper proposes a generic architecture of regulated software systems that facilitates compliance with high-level policies through regulatory services. Our architectural model has the flexibility to adapt to norm modifications and to norm violations by including ex-post enforcement mechanisms. The proposed solution is assessed using a case study and a prototype implementation in the eFLINT and ASC2 languages for modeling norms and software/social agents respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @JURIX2022</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-jurix/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>Can a military autonomous device follow International Humanitarian Law?&lt;/b> by Tomasz Zurek, Jonathan Kwik, Mostafa Mohajeriparizi and Tom Van Engers was accepted at &lt;a href="https://jurix2022.rechtsinformatik.saarland/">&lt;b>35th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems&lt;/b>&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This paper introduces a modular architecture for integrating norms in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. As the the interactions between norms and agents can be complex, this architecture utilizes multiple programmable components to model concepts such as adoption of multiple personal and/or collective possibly conflicting norms, interpretation and qualification between social and normative contexts, possibility of intentionally (non-)compliant behaviors and resolving conflicts between norms and desires (or other norms). The architecture revolves around &lt;i>normative advisors&lt;/i> that act as the bridge between intentional agents and the institutional reality. As a technical contribution, a running implementation of the architecture is presented based on the ASC2 (AgentScript) BDI framework and eFLINT norm reasoner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preference-Based Goal Refinement in BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/aamas_2022_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/aamas_2022_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Modular Architecture for Integrating Normative Advisors in MAS</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/mohajeri-parizi-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/mohajeri-parizi-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Seamless Integration and Testing for MAS Engineering</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/emas_2021_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/emas_2021_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Declarative Preferences in Reactive BDI Agents</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2020_mostafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/prima2020_mostafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Run, Agent, Run!
