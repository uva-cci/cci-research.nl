&lt;p>One of the highlights was the publication of the paper, “Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments” (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689488.3689991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOI&lt;/a>), which he had the privilege of presenting at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPLASH 2024&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/paint-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAINT&lt;/a>) in Pasadena, California, last October. He attended the conference alongside Chris, Damien, and Thomas, who also delivered their own presentations (&lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/post/splash-conf-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post&lt;/a>). Sharing his work and receiving insightful feedback from so many brilliant minds marked a significant milestone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the academic front, Max is in the final stages of his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis and is preparing for his defense later this month. Additionally, he recently began working part-time as a Student Research Assistant at CCI to continue the research from his thesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He looks forward to building on these experiences as he continues his work with CCI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 Papers Accepted at SPLASH 2024</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/splash-conf-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/splash-conf-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>Members of the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complex Cyber Infrastructure&lt;/a> group have been hard at work on the topic of software languages, developing methods and tools improving the productivity and control of programmers and language-designers.
The latest contributions are being published in three articles, which will each be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPLASH 2024&lt;/a> in Pasadena, California.
Each contribution provides a piece of the puzzle of developing large and complex software systems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/paint-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAINT&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Max Boksem and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article characterises and demonstrates a fundamentally graph-based programming environment: programs are built from explicitly-linked parts. This approach has benefits from two different, existing kinds of programming environment, which together make program parts easier to maintain and re-use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Links: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689488.3689991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOI&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/paint2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRE-PRINT&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the Soundness of Auto-completion Services for Dynamically Typed Languages
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/gpce-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPCE&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Damian Frölich and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article presents a novel mechanism for code editors to assist programmers by auto-suggesting identifiers. The novelty is that suggestions are based on an analysis of the program that is shallow enough to be fast and language-agnostic, but deep enough to guarantee suggestions are always valid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Links: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689484.3690734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOI&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/files/papers/gpce2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRE-PRINT&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cooperative Specification via Composition Control
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to be presented at &lt;a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/sle-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SLE&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>by Christopher Esterhuyse and Thomas van Binsbergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summary: This article presents a framework for using specification languages in a context where the specifications are developed from parts by cooperating agents. Some language features that are useful for this purpose are identified, and used to improve three existing specification languages&lt;/li>
