&lt;p>Maximilian Barger, &lt;a href="https://vu.nl/en/education/master/computer-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSc Computer Security&lt;/a>
student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, conducted a research project
under the supervision of CCI members Marco Brohet and Francesco Regazzoni on
implementing post-quantum remote attestation on RISC-V devices. He presented his
work at CompSys 2023 and received the Best Short Paper Award. Congratulations, Max!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.compsys.science/conference/current/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Conference on Computer Systems (CompSys)&lt;/a>
is the premier forum for Dutch research into Computer Systems research. The aim
is to showcase success stories while also fostering and strengthening collaboration.

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With embedded devices becoming more pervasive and entrenched in society, it is
paramount to keep these systems secure. A threat plaguing these systems consists
of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing
an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but
suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be
mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware,
we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored
for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses
beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting
memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the
security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software
and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair
comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current
implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively
small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still
required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows,
to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards,
resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more
harmonized evaluation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call for Papers: CARDIS 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to
exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart
cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life through their
use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT devices. It is
thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and
to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable
performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from
industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the
field of embedded security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 22nd edition of CARDIS will be organized by Francesco Regazzoni, Kostas
Papagiannopoulos and Marco Brohet from the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group
of the University of Amsterdam in Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an
in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are
required to participate to the conference in presence).&lt;/p>

&lt;em>Snelle Jelle and the Daltons&lt;/em> featuring among others CCI members Tim, Damian,
Christopher and Marco, won the &lt;strong>Most Cheerful Outfit&lt;/strong> prize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Out of the 16 teams participating, the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5659248/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>The Daltons&lt;/em>&lt;/a>
look-alikes with fellow members of the MNS and PCS research groups from our SNE
cluster, managed to conquer the 11th place. A very nice result for the first
particpation, which we could not have achieved without our dedicated SNE
supporters that kept cheering for us until the very end. A special thanks to you!&lt;/p>
