&lt;h1 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Encryption is a method to keep our data safe from third parties. However,
side-channel information may be leaked during encryption due to physical
properties. This information can be used in side-channel attacks to recover
critical values such as the secret encryption key. To this end, it is necessary
to understand the robustness of implementations to assess the security of data
handled by a device. Side-channel attacks are one such method which allow
researchers to evaluate the robustness of implementations using appropriate
metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the security community, machine learning is playing a
prominent role in the study of side-channel attacks. A notable
example of this is the use of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE)
as a preprocessing step on the measurements. In this work
we study in depth the problem of finding the most suitable
architecture of such Convolutional Autoencoders. To this end,
Optuna is used to explore the CAE hyperparameter space. This
process allows us to identify hyperparameters that outperform
state-of-the-art autoencoders, reducing the needed traces for
a succesful attack by approximately 37% in the presence of
Gaussian noise and reducing the trainable parameters needed
to attack desynchronization by a factor of 29. In addition to the
promising results, experiments carried out in this paper allow
a better understanding of the hyperparameter space in the field
of side channel attacks, providing a solid base for future use of
CAE in this specific domain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Published at ACM Computing Surveys</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-csur/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-published-csur/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper &amp;lsquo;A Survey on Thwarting Memory Corruption in RISC-V&amp;rsquo;, authored by

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With embedded devices becoming more pervasive and entrenched in society, it is
paramount to keep these systems secure. A threat plaguing these systems consists
of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing
an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but
suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be
mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware,
we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored
for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses
beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting
memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the
security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software
and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair
comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current
implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively
small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still
required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows,
to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards,
resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more
harmonized evaluation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call for Papers: CARDIS 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to
exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart
cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life through their
use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT devices. It is
thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and
to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable
performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from
industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the
field of embedded security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 22nd edition of CARDIS will be organized by Francesco Regazzoni, Kostas
Papagiannopoulos and Marco Brohet from the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group
of the University of Amsterdam in Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an
in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are
required to participate to the conference in presence).&lt;/p>
