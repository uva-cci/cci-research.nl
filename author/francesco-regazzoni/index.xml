&lt;p>Maximilian Barger, &lt;a href="https://vu.nl/en/education/master/computer-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSc Computer Security&lt;/a>
student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, conducted a research project
under the supervision of CCI members Marco Brohet and Francesco Regazzoni on
implementing post-quantum remote attestation on RISC-V devices. He presented his
work at CompSys 2023 and received the Best Short Paper Award. Congratulations, Max!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.compsys.science/conference/current/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Conference on Computer Systems (CompSys)&lt;/a>
is the premier forum for Dutch research into Computer Systems research. The aim
is to showcase success stories while also fostering and strengthening collaboration.
CompSys 2023 was hosted at &lt;a href="https://www.kontaktderkontinenten.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotel Kontakt der Kontinenten&lt;/a>
in Soesterberg.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call for Papers: CARDIS 2023</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/cardis-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to
exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart
cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life through their
use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT devices. It is
thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and
to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable
performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from
industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the
field of embedded security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 22nd edition of CARDIS will be organized by Francesco Regazzoni, Kostas
Papagiannopoulos and Marco Brohet from the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group
of the University of Amsterdam in Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an
in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are
required to participate to the conference in presence).&lt;/p>
