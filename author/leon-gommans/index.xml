On the one hand, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/cees-de-laat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cees de Laat&lt;/a>, the former Chair of CCI, retired recently.
This symposium looked at where the systems, networking and complex cyber infrastructures field stands today, a field to which Cees has contributed greatly.
On the other hand, the symposium celebrated &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/leon-gommans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leon Gommans&lt;/a> for becoming Professor by Special Appointment in the area of Complex Cyber Infrastructure for Data Exchange Systems within CCI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Turing Zaal in Amsterdam Science Park was packed with people, some of whom came from other continents to salute Cees and Leon on this special occasion.
The audience enjoyed talks by a lineup of distinguished speakers.
The symposium was opened by &lt;a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/g/r/p.grosso/p.grosso.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paola Grosso&lt;/a> from the Multiscale Networked Systems group.
In the first talk, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/leon-gommans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leon Gommans&lt;/a> explained how multi-domain authorization research evolved into data exchange systems research.
Leon was followed by &lt;a href="https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/about-amcr/staff/computer-science/john-shalf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Shalf&lt;/a>, Department Head for Computer Science at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who talked about the future of computing beyond exascale.
The first session ended with a very personal talk by &lt;a href="https://www.vuhpdc.net/henri-bal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henri Bal&lt;/a> from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, entitled &amp;ldquo;Networking with Cees&amp;rdquo;.
After the break, Dutch Internet pioneer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kees_Neggers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kees Neggers&lt;/a> took the floor with a historical overview from ARPANET to complex cyber infrastructures.
In the sequel, the second speaker from the USA, &lt;a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/research/researcher_spotlight/wuerthwein_frank.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Würthwein&lt;/a>, Director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center, focused on the future of open research platforms.
The last talk was given by &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/cees-de-laat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cees de Laat&lt;/a>, who shared several insights as well as numerous funny and memorable moments from his career.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symposium, which was organized by the &lt;a href="https://mns-research.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiscale Networked Systems&lt;/a> group, the &lt;a href="https://pcs-research.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parallel Computing Systems&lt;/a> group, and CCI, ended with a reception, giving the attendants the opportunity to meet old and new friends.
For sure, this afternoon will be a pleasant and inspiring memory for the people who had the honor to be present.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Effective Collaboration in Cybersecurity Alliances Using Social Computational Trust</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/deljoo-managing-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Data Market Architecture and Functional Components</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/publication/demchenko-open-2019/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
