The UVA team included &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/sander-klous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sander Klous&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anestisdalgkitsis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anestis Dalgitsis&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/alexandros-koufakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandros Koufakis&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/author/cees-de-laat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cees de Laat&lt;/a> (left to right on picture) and &lt;a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/g/r/p.grosso/p.grosso.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paola Grosso&lt;/a> (not pictured).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We showcased the results of two distinct research efforts. The first project, led by Anestis, focused on &lt;strong>LLM-Based Optimization Algorithm Selection for High-Performance Networks Orchestration&lt;/strong>. The second, led by Alexandros, demonstrated &lt;strong>Policy-aware Distributed Vertical Federated Learning infrastructure&lt;/strong>. Both works used the &lt;a href="https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FABRIC&lt;/a> testbed and live demonstrations took place at the &lt;a href="https://www.ciena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIENA&lt;/a> booth. The demonstrations used CIENA&amp;rsquo;s mobile FABRIC node (pictured above).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>LLM-Based Optimization&lt;/em> work was published and presented on the &lt;a href="https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Innovating the Network for Data-Intensive Science&amp;rdquo; (INDIS)&lt;/em>&lt;/a> workshop. Both projects were featured on the &lt;a href="https://renci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RENCI&lt;/a> booth as examples of innovative research enabled by the FABRIC infrastructure. Additionally, they were presented on the &lt;a href="https://scinethpc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciNet&lt;/a> theater on the exhibition floor.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="llm-based-optimization-algorithm-selection-for-high-performance-networks-orchestration">LLM-Based Optimization Algorithm Selection for High-Performance Networks Orchestration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for optimization algorithm selection to address the growing complexity of high-performance, multi-domain network orchestration. The proposed solution introduces a context-aware abstraction layer where LLMs analyze network logs, service requests, and algorithm metadata to dynamically select the most suitable optimization strategy. We validate our framework through a prototype deployed on the FABRIC FAB international testbed and through simulations across diverse scenarios (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, V2X, AR/VR), showing that LLM-driven selection achieves higher success rates and SLA compliance while balancing efficiency, accuracy, and inference latency. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this method and highlight its potential to enable scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving orchestration.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="policy-aware-distributed-vertical-federated-learning-infrastructure">Policy-aware distributed Vertical Federated Learning infrastructure &lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Harnessing the power of data is paramount to unlocking more effective applications, especially with the rise of machine learning. Data regulation, both through legislation and company policies, makes it impractical for different companies to learn from multiple datasets at once. Digital Data Marketplaces aim to solve this issue, by providing a platform where organizations can exchange data based on (dynamic) policies. The digital data marketplace enforces these policies, allowing only data exchange that does not violate policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this work we demonstration how multiple geographically distributed companies can train a unified machine learning model collaboratively using Vertical Federated Learning. Towards this goal we designed and implemented &lt;a href="https://github.com/DYNAMOS-UVA/Scattered-Directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scattered Directive&lt;/a>, a state-of-the-art distributed infrastructure deployment utilizing FABRIC, capable of automatically deploying a digital data marketplace platform. Scattered Directive is built ontop of &lt;a href="https://github.com/DYNAMOS-UVA/DYNAMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DYNAMOS&lt;/a>, a middleware for datachange systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the effect of dynamic data sharing policies and the impact on the universal model training.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monday at INDIS 2024:&lt;/strong>
We kicked off the week by presenting our work at the &lt;a href="https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INDIS&lt;/a> 2024 workshop, held on November 18. Our &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jorrit05/DYNAMOS/blob/main/docs/papers/federated_learning/INDIS_2024_Short_Paper_Final_v2_1_45.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper&lt;/a>, “Microservices-based FABRIC Implementation of Collaborative Model Training Scenario with Vertical Federated Learning,” tackled the challenge of using geographically distributed proprietary data for collaborative AI model training while adhering to data privacy and protection.
Using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jorrit05/DYNAMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DYNAMOS&lt;/a> middleware and the FABRIC network, we demonstrated how the problem of building energy consumption prediction (inspired by our collaborators &lt;a href="https://www.prets.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prets&lt;/a>) can be addressed using a diverse set of partners. Participants with heterogeneous datasets can collaborate to create a unified model for prediction building energy consumption, without compromising privacy or intellectual property. This solution could reinforce green energy adoption and enable more economically viable building renovation financing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tuesday on the SCinet Stage:&lt;/strong>
On November 19, we took to the SCinet Theater on the exhibition floor to show our ideas in action. Our &lt;a href="https://delaat.net/sc/sc24/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo&lt;/a> featured the FABRIC network&amp;rsquo;s topology and showcased how Vertical Federated Learning could be used to train a model that predicts energy consumption while protecting sensitive data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./SciNet_presentation.jpg" alt="SciNet presentation">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exhibition Floor Action:&lt;/strong>
Until Thursday, November 21, we were hosted at &lt;a href="https://www.ciena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIENA’s&lt;/a> booth, where we continued to showcase our demonstration and connect with visitors from around the world.&lt;/p>
