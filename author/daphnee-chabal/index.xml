Essential yet often overlooked, security ensures that our daily transactions remain protected, that our infrastructure operates regularly and that our communication stays private and safe from unauthorized parties. The aim of Introduction to Security is to provide solid foundations on the overall security domain, starting from the core components of cryptographic theory, implementations and cryptanalysis. Subsequently, it shows how secure are used to build the cryptographic protocols deployed in our everyday life, and we continue by covering the fundamentals of operating systems&amp;rsquo; security, intrusion detection/prevention and recent research topics such as privacy-preserving technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within CCI, our research strives to develop and apply open-source, efficient, protected and tailor-made cryptographic implementations that ensure the security, privacy and availability of our society&amp;rsquo;s communication infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Protection Technologies</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course focuses on technologies that can be used to protect data from unauthorized access. The main motivation is to protect personal data and comply with data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The course&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>explains the context of data protection technologies from multiple angles (e.g., legal requirements, interplay with other quality attributes);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conveys in-depth knowledge on some specific data protection technologies (e.g., cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, anonymization and pseudonymization, differential privacy, access control, anonymous communications);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>showcases applications of data protection technologies (in particular, privacy-preserving machine learning and location privacy).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The course is closely linked to the research performed by CCI researchers in the field of security and privacy (for example, in the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/secured/">SECURED&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect">FogProtect&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/epi">EPI&lt;/a> projects).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper Accepted @PPAI23</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-ppai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/post/paper-accepted-ppai/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper titled &lt;b>On Achieving Privacy-Preserving State-of-the-Art Edge Intelligence&lt;/b> by Daphnee Chabal, Dolly Sapra,

&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) Inference in Edge Computing, often coined Edge Intelligence, requires solutions to insure that
sensitive data confidentiality and intellectual property are not revealed in the process. Privacy-preserving Edge Intelligence
is only emerging, despite the growing prevalence of Edge Computing as a context of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service. Solutions have
yet to be applied to state-of-the-art DNNs. This position paper provides an original assessment of the compatibility of existing
techniques for privacy-preserving DNN Inference with the characteristics of an Edge Computing setup. The resulting favorite
candidate is secret sharing. We then address the future role of model compression methods in the research towards secret sharing
on DNNs with state-of-the-art performance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
