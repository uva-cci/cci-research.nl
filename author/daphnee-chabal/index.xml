&lt;h3>Abstract:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) Inference in Edge Computing, often coined Edge Intelligence, requires solutions to insure that
sensitive data confidentiality and intellectual property are not revealed in the process. Privacy-preserving Edge Intelligence
is only emerging, despite the growing prevalence of Edge Computing as a context of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service. Solutions have
yet to be applied to state-of-the-art DNNs. This position paper provides an original assessment of the compatibility of existing
techniques for privacy-preserving DNN Inference with the characteristics of an Edge Computing setup. The resulting favorite
candidate is secret sharing. We then address the future role of model compression methods in the research towards secret sharing
on DNNs with state-of-the-art performance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
