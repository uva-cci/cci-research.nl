Science Park Open Day, CCI members Kyrian and Marco gave a demo on how scientists
hack hardware&amp;ndash;in an effort to make it more secure, afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was CCI&amp;rsquo;s second participation in the Open Day. It was a great success, with
lots of families amazed by the FPGAs and hardware we showcased and the oscilloscope
showing waveforms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://opendagamsterdamsciencepark.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amsterdam Science Park Open Day&lt;/a>
is a collaboration of Amsterdam Science Park, AMOLF, ARCNL, CWI, Nikhef, and the
University of Amsterdam. It is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.weekendvandewetenschap.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>Weekend van de Wetenschap&lt;/em>&lt;/a>
(Weekend of Science), held anually in the first weekend of October. The event is
an initiative of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, aimed to
make the world of science and technology accessible to people of all ages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Protection Technologies</title><link>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cci-research.nl/teaching/data_protection_technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course focuses on technologies that can be used to protect data from unauthorized access. The main motivation is to protect personal data and comply with data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The course&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>explains the context of data protection technologies from multiple angles (e.g., legal requirements, interplay with other quality attributes);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conveys in-depth knowledge on some specific data protection technologies (e.g., cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, anonymization and pseudonymization, differential privacy, access control, anonymous communications);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>showcases applications of data protection technologies (in particular, privacy-preserving machine learning and location privacy).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The course is closely linked to the research performed by CCI researchers in the field of security and privacy (for example, in the &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/secured/">SECURED&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/fogprotect">FogProtect&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cci-research.nl/project/epi">EPI&lt;/a> projects).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
