Currently, many of the processes for monitoring and enforcing these regulations are performed manually. &lt;a href="https://github.com/DYNAMOS-UVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DYNAMOS&lt;/a> (Dynamically Adaptive Microservice-based OS) is a data exchange middleware system that is designed to be self-adaptive, employing extensible algorithms to dynamically generate microservice compositions and select archetype patterns based on policy, user input, or system events. DYNAMOS makes use of sidecars for communication abstraction, protocol buffers for strict interface definition, and ephemeral single-use jobs for enhanced security as pivotal strategies. In conclusion, DYNAMOS demonstrates the potential for creating a more efficient and secure data exchange environment, enabling businesses and researchers to share information while maintaining control over their data.&lt;/p>
